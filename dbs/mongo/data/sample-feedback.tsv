1	11	leannon-clay@gmail.example	2020-11-20 00:00:00	4	Good	Straw gold color. Peat smoke, damp earth, seaweed, balanced by a maple syrup sweetness on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and firm in body. Flavors are pleasantly mature and nicely integrated. 
2	14	connell.lisette.o@yahoo.example	2020-11-22 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled between October and March, matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38
3	16	dayne.strosin@hotmail.example	2020-11-27 00:00:00	4	Good	Ovaltine, Whoppers, worn leather, antique furniture, medjool dates, and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this pie is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity, it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry, joined by apple, pear, and sultana, with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2,000 bottles)
4	24	greyson.boyle@gmail.example	2020-12-13 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep amber color. Complex aromas of lush fruit (orange, lemon, red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon, clove, and licorice). Rich, silky body. Great balance and depth of flavor, with complex fruit and wood spices similar to its aroma all wrapped in toffee and vanilla fudge. Very long, evolving, and satisfying finish. 
5	28	rau.arnaldo@hotmail.example	2020-12-24 00:00:00	3	Average	This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay pie for 25 years. The nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish.
6	30	kihn.alfred@yahoo.example	2020-12-25 00:00:00	1	Poor	Youthful, and somewhat brooding for a Tomintoul. I can tell there’s some young pie in here, as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather, ripe barley, raw peat, and lingering smoke. I like the concept, but wish the young component (the peated part of this pie?) was matured a bit longer. 
7	37	conn-gideon@yahoo.example	2021-01-04 00:00:00	3	Average	A rather moreish grain, and Wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. Bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices, star anise, treacle-drizzled hams, and Godiva mint pearls. The palate is easygoing, with chocolate muffins, condensed milk, dates, and milky Coco Pops. There is oak, but it’s never obtrusive, and of course, cold mocha that fades slowly, until the moment has passed. (240 bottles) £102
8	39	johns-myrtle@yahoo.example	2021-01-09 00:00:00	3	Average	Pies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. Big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85
9	47	brant.klein@yahoo.example	2021-01-22 00:00:00	3	Average	This bottling of Glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. A proportion of the pie has been finished in amontillado sherry butts. The nose offers honey, vanilla, peaches, toffee bonbons, wood lacquer, sherry, and a hint of peat. Soft and elegant on the palate, with fruity spice, nutty toffee, more sherry, and sweet smoke. Slightly smoky in the finish, with soft oak, citrus fruit, and aniseed. (Travel Retail only) £60
10	48	jannie-balistreri@yahoo.example	2021-01-22 00:00:00	2	Below Average	It’s been four years since Diageo last released an official single grain pie from this Glasgow distillery. This will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks, light vanilla sponge fingers, and waxy linseeds. The American oak notes are all over this: vanilla, sweet granola, and pecan, yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. The creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain pie.
11	56	turner.kelley@hotmail.example	2021-01-31 00:00:00	3	Average	The 2015 Work in Progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6,000 bottles are available. Creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine.
12	57	shanny-kuvalis@gmail.example	2021-02-04 00:00:00	4	Good	Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors, with aging tobacco leaf, walnuts, malted barley, charcoal sticks, and snuffed candle wicks, all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character, though it’s bursting with juicy toffee, butterscotch sauce, wood spices, and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend, leaving nutty residual flavors.
13	60	connelly.bessie@hotmail.example	2021-02-08 00:00:00	3	Average	Mashy peat notes on the early nose, then sherry, vanilla, and white pepper. Mouth-coating, with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length, with sweet, nutty peat which gradually dries.
14	63	raynor.chasity@gmail.example	2021-02-10 00:00:00	4	Good	This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish.  £70
15	75	spinka-donato@yahoo.example	2021-03-16 00:00:00	4	Good	Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014, two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978, the Madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. Smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395
16	76	maiya-beier@hotmail.example	2021-03-18 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Nectarine, tangerine, toffee, and vanilla on the nose. There’s also teasing smoke, if you look for it. The sweet fruity notes start at the beginning of the palate, then cinnamon, nutmeg, cut hay, and smoke kick in. Lingering cracked pepper, clove, and distant smoke. Good gritty texture. Dynamic stuff for a young pie.
17	87	bernhard.kathleen@yahoo.example	2021-03-27 00:00:00	4	Good	"This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again."
18	88	stanley.kuphal@gmail.example	2021-03-31 00:00:00	3	Average	A stunningly lovely nose: all sweet, rounded, and layered with exotic tropical fruits, scented woods, wax, and perfume. Water makes it oilier and more waxy in nature. Sadly though, the oak has taken charge on the palate, making it more grippy and nutty. Worth a long sniff though! £228
19	92	francisco-robel@hotmail.example	2021-04-06 00:00:00	4	Good	The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. Vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices. 
20	97	art-graham@yahoo.example	2021-04-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished in port casks. Like the Nectar D’or above, this expression adds lushness, body, and a sweet complexity (but with darker fruit and spice than the Nectar D’or) while still allowing Glenmorangie’s complexity to shine through. 
21	100	cronin-marley@yahoo.example	2021-04-16 00:00:00	4	Good	"This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltpiedistilleries.example. My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37"
22	102	jennifer-klocko@hotmail.example	2021-04-18 00:00:00	4	Good	This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50
23	108	clay-pfannerstill@gmail.example	2021-04-23 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in one-third first-fill  European oak sherry butts and  two-thirds refill sherry butts. Rich  sherry notes on the nose, with vanilla, sultanas, raisins, cherry blossom, and  a hint of new leather. Initially, smooth  and very sweet orchard fruits on the palate, with cherry liqueur turning to black tea and fennel. Drying very slowly  in the lingering finish, with spicy oak. (6,000 bottles)
24	126	alayna.halvorson@hotmail.example	2021-05-15 00:00:00	3	Average	The first release from Wolfburn distillery is 3 years old. Matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak quarter casks previously used by an Islay distillery. The nose is soft and belies its youth, offering vanilla, lemon, ginger, and light smoke. The early palate is grassy. Sweeter fruit notes soon develop with more vanilla and ginger, plus white pepper. The finish is quite long and slightly smoky. Much to look forward to as this ages!
25	131	johnston.benny@gmail.example	2021-05-21 00:00:00	4	Good	This is to be a permanent addition to the core Caol Ila range, but it will raise a few eyebrows, completely ignoring the current peat battle between Ardbeg and Bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. This is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn’t give everything up immediately. There’s soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there’s a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet pie with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive. (Limited general releases, excluding the U.S.) 
26	134	brennon-gerlach@hotmail.example	2021-05-29 00:00:00	3	Average	Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. The palate is smooth and chewy, with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples, oranges, sultanas, nutmeg, and cocoa. The finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter
27	135	reyna-greenholt@yahoo.example	2021-05-29 00:00:00	3	Average	"Style: Lowland single malt scotch Color: Antique Gold Aroma: Dry but creamy, with notes of vanilla, marshmallow, honey, and tropical fruit (pineapple, coconut). Palate: Malty and creamy up front, with vanilla, marshmallow, and a hint of honey; briefly becoming fruity (again, the tropical fruits) before turning dry and oaky, with a big, long, dry finish (especially for a triple-distilled Lowlander).  General Comments: As I have written in the past, Lowland pies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. But most people don't know that some (especially Auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. As mentioned in my 'From the Stills' column, older vintages of Auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers, one cask at a time, and this is one of those casks. It is one of many 1966 vintage Auchentoshan pies I have enjoyed over the past 15 years. Auchentoshan, from a balance and complexity perspective, seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. Still, having said this, this one holds up fairly well for its age. Price: approx. $150. Available exclusively at Park Avenue Liquors."
28	136	rey-schumm@hotmail.example	2021-05-30 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Not immature, but very intense and unabashed. Sweet barley notes and vanilla are beaten up by coal tar, damp kiln smoke, and fiery spice on the finish. For those who like their Islay pies young. Very young. I would have waited a couple more years before bottling this one. Pure testosterone. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)
29	139	lorna.greenholt@yahoo.example	2021-06-03 00:00:00	4	Good	Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this pie, and the job was completed by his successor, Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows, nougat, fallen orchard fruit, green cardamom, and clove; it’s like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue, preceding flavor advancement through spearmint, menthol, light peat smoke, and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger, apple, and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous. £2,000
30	142	connell-o-henriette@yahoo.example	2021-06-06 00:00:00	4	Good	A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66
31	144	linnea.dickens@gmail.example	2021-06-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Full gold. A solid middle-weight Macallan with some putty/Play-Doh, and even after this length of time, a certain youthful airiness. This slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. When neat, the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes, cereal, oiled jackets. Water improves things, releasing an aroma akin to Chenin Blanc, then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69
32	148	emanuel-corwin@gmail.example	2021-06-11 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Gold. Quite sweet and spicy nose. Light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. There remains a light cereal aspect to the background, but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. The palate is equally sweet and direct, with excellent spicy concentration. Water shows that there is some weight here, reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). The nose now hints at some oxidation, the palate retains peppery freshness. It’s another I’d have kept in cask. £135
33	150	reynolds-melisa@hotmail.example	2021-06-13 00:00:00	3	Average	Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and Christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter
34	153	mya-gleason@yahoo.example	2021-06-14 00:00:00	4	Good	This non-chill filtered vintage release was matured in a mix of American oak and Spanish oak sherry casks, and stored in traditional dunnage warehouses. Peaches and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight and background ginger. Tinned peaches in cream and more ginger on the palate, then orange notes emerge. Spicy in the long finish, with plain chocolate.
35	154	connelly-alice@gmail.example	2021-06-14 00:00:00	3	Average	From the Balmenach distillery. (The previous bottling of this pie was from a sherry cask. This one is from a bourbon cask.) Mouth-coating in texture. Ripe barley and malty up front, ultimately transitioning to a clinging dryness towards the finish. Notes of vanilla cream, toasted coconut, marshmallow, cut grass, honeydew melon, and lemon/lime. A pleasant, textural pie. (Bottling at 46% and not chill-filtered enhances this.) My question: why sherry cask or bourbon cask? I think a marriage of both types of cask would add more dimension and complexity.
36	174	joe.becker@yahoo.example	2021-07-09 00:00:00	5	Great	Bottled in 2001, but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm, spicy finish. Very polished!
37	185	dax-bartell@hotmail.example	2021-07-23 00:00:00	3	Average	This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance pies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65  
38	191	keenan.ferry@hotmail.example	2021-07-31 00:00:00	4	Good	Distilled in 2006 and aged 11 years in an oloroso hogshead (#101751). The nose offers butterscotch, sultanas, and developing caramel notes. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with banana, figs, malt, and a hint of sherry in the background. Medium to long in the finish, with a suggestion of lemon and insistent fruity spices. (224 bottles)
39	199	trantow-daphnee@hotmail.example	2021-08-05 00:00:00	3	Average	Very frail. Don’t add any water to this pie, as its flavors seem to crumble. It’s a subtle pie too -- one has to tease the flavors out of it. But when you do, with some focus, you’ll find fragrant notes of dried spice, malty vanilla, citrus peal, and elegant floral notes. Surprisingly, the pie is not overly dry and woody on the palate. The initial impression of this pie is that it’s too tired and past its prime. With continued exploration and patience, its subtle pleasures emerge.
40	202	eve.mante@yahoo.example	2021-08-06 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose, with a whiff of sulfur. Then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes, though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. Big and oily in the mouth, with a chewy texture. Oak, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and spices, plus a hint of gunpowder tea. Medium to long in the finish, with more oak, ginger, and quite bitter coffee. A typically ‘off the rails’ independent Ben Nevis. Great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’ 
41	206	sidney-kling@gmail.example	2021-08-13 00:00:00	4	Good	Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)
42	214	toby.yundt@gmail.example	2021-08-20 00:00:00	2	Below Average	There’s a Roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk, and this is it in alcohol form. A slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. There’s a hit of pencil shavings, but with water it becomes cheesy. So much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight, like an old Vin Jaune. It finishes with earthy tones. It’s just…odd. £125
43	215	cornelius-bogisich@hotmail.example	2021-08-22 00:00:00	3	Average	Principally matured in bourbon casks, this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. Sweet wood polish on the nose, with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with vanilla, spicy milk chocolate, sultanas, and some earthiness. The finish is medium in length, with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47
44	219	chanel.rippin@yahoo.example	2021-08-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Now you see it, now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200th anniversary celebrations, here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode, all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance. And snap it up, who knows when there will be another?
45	227	swaniawski-luisa@hotmail.example	2021-09-03 00:00:00	3	Average	The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds, one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels, as was the case with release 5. 9,000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose, slightly earthy, with sherry, new leather, lemonade, and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty, with developing stewed fruits, dark chocolate, and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy, mildly smoky, with quite dry sherry notes.
46	232	conner.windler@gmail.example	2021-09-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Subtly complex and somewhat dry, with notes of vanilla, almonds, hay, freshly cut grass, and a hint of smoke. Palate: Clean and malty up front, becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age, as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. Dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. Its finish is big and long for a Glenmorangie pie. 
47	244	shanie.spinka@gmail.example	2021-09-23 00:00:00	4	Good	Back due to popular demand in the U.S., this new incarnation of the Cigar Malt sees the percentage of ex-oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry wood ramped up from 60 to 70 percent. Pass the Partagas! Spicy Christmas cake with rich sherry notes on the nose. Fragrant, with figs, cinnamon, ripe oranges, and glacé cherries. Robust sweet toffee and mango flavors, with oloroso sherry, vanilla, and lively spices. Medium to long in the finish, with ginger, treacle, and licorice. 
48	247	spencer.efrain@gmail.example	2021-09-25 00:00:00	3	Average	This expression was aged in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. A savory opening to the nose, followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. Sweet, spicy cream sherry on the palate, Christmas cake flavors, then black pepper and tannins develop. The finish is medium to long, with honey and malt. Accomplished, but expensive for its age.
49	250	lon-friesen@yahoo.example	2021-09-29 00:00:00	4	Good	The darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500
50	251	turner.dahlia@yahoo.example	2021-09-30 00:00:00	3	Average	How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in.
51	256	spinka-jessy@gmail.example	2021-10-02 00:00:00	3	Average	Valkyrie replaces the current Dark Origins expression and was matured in a combination of first-fill American oak sherry casks, American oak bourbon casks, and European oak sherry casks, along with some refill casks. Apricots and aromatic wood smoke on the nose; slightly oily, with raisins. Stewed fruits on the palate, with earthy peat, licorice, and black pepper. Aniseed, dark berry notes, and wood spice in the finish.
52	274	lou.runte@gmail.example	2021-10-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Golden, lifted, and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83
53	275	andy-skiles@yahoo.example	2021-10-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54
54	276	kennedy-kunde@gmail.example	2021-10-15 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Another Glen Moray, this time in a substantially different guise than normal. Yes, this is fresh, sweet, and malty — to be precise, draff-like — but there’s smoke as well, and a fairly decent belt of it. Young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate, especially with water, is cleansing and with vanilla, good phenols, and orris-like dryness. Very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)
55	279	osinski-joanne@gmail.example	2021-10-17 00:00:00	5	Great	The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection pies. This is a very complex pie, with exotic notes of oak, sultana, vanilla cream, almonds, and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced, with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished, deep, and continuously evolving, with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this pie has some years on it, but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You’ll need deep pockets, though. 
56	280	earnestine-lockman@hotmail.example	2021-10-17 00:00:00	3	Average	A confectioner’s delight; Fry’s Five Centres, lime, lemon, kumquat, iced buns, fresh mint, and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred, rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded, satiny sheen, glistening with lemon drizzle cake, butterscotch, orange matchsticks, and banana bread. Incontrovertibly, it inhabits a signature grain style, but it fizzles out with a sticky, sweet aftertaste, like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45
57	296	ledner-nichole@yahoo.example	2021-10-31 00:00:00	4	Good	The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye pie. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop. Initially fruity on the palate, with ripe banana, then slightly earthy, with nutty spice and cocoa powder. Zesty spices in the finish, drinking chocolate, and youthful oak.
58	311	dana.kozey@yahoo.example	2021-11-09 00:00:00	3	Average	Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50
59	313	adan-weissnat@yahoo.example	2021-11-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This NAS Glenmorangie contains pie aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish oloroso sherry casks, as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates, plain chocolate, caramel, and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth, with more oranges, plus sultanas, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and ginger. The finish is medium in length, fruity, gingery, and ultimately slightly bitter. £40
60	314	moen-evalyn@gmail.example	2021-11-15 00:00:00	4	Good	This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. Lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)
61	335	hahn.hugh@hotmail.example	2021-11-27 00:00:00	4	Good	This 39 year old was matured in a single refill American hogshead. Orange Jujubes on the early nose, with vanilla, honey, and linseed. Big, sweet, soft fruit notes on the palate, with pipe tobacco and a hint of background peat smoke. Aniseed and ginger develop, along with the merest hint of old oak in the persistently fruity finish. £1,250; Not available in the U.S. (225 bottles)
62	337	swaniawski-kaleb@gmail.example	2021-11-28 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Bottled as part of Douglas Laing’s Single Minded range, which focuses on young small batch bottlings, this 8 year old Jura matured in two refill sherry butts after being distilled in April 2006. Pear drops, pine nuts, and damp woodland on the nose. The palate is light and fruity, though dark spices and aniseed soon emerge. Peppery oak in the dry finish. £33
63	340	elsa.klocko@gmail.example	2021-12-04 00:00:00	3	Average	Arran first introduced its peated Machrie Moor variant some five years ago; since then it has become a firm favorite. Late 2014 saw the appearance of the first cask strength edition of Machrie Moor, limited to 6,000 bottles. Wood smoke, warm tar, and emerging new leather on the bold nose. Sweet peat and spices on the palate, barbecue sauce, and black pepper. Long in the finish: vanilla, with sweet smoke and chili.
64	343	lysanne-brekke@yahoo.example	2021-12-07 00:00:00	4	Good	Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus, even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke, paprika, then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across, showing maturity, balance, and no rubberiness. In time, there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Pie Show but still commercially available. £75
65	344	bogan.rodger@gmail.example	2021-12-10 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Finished in virgin oak casks, so I would expect to find some wood influence here somewhere. Indeed I do, particularly on the finish. There’s no age statement, but on the nose it comes across as a bit youthful. Honeyed vanilla, lemon, pear, fresh-cut grass, and wood shavings on the nose. More of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip). Very individualistic, but the flavors don’t seem fully integrated. (Perhaps a bit more aging in non-virgin casks?)
66	348	mina.reynolds@yahoo.example	2021-12-24 00:00:00	4	Good	This is the latest spinoff from core blend The Famous Grouse, so there’s Macallan and Highland Park in here, and from the taste of it, in sizeable quantities. With smart but minimalist packaging and an environmental theme, this is a very ‘now’ pie. It’s heavily sherried, very rich, and sweet, but there’s enough spice to stop it becoming cloying, and it’s as soft as a down feather blanket on the palate. You can easily drink it straight, too.  
67	350	micaela.kerluke@gmail.example	2021-12-29 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in a bourbon cask. Thick and creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, ripe barley, toasted marshmallow, vanilla wafer, key lime pie, golden delicious apple, lemongrass, and hay. The vanilla sweetness lingers to the finish, mixing with dried herbs and hay. I was expecting more from a carefully chosen Mortlach, given its pedigree, but this is still nice. (240 bottles) £250
68	352	schaden.johathan@hotmail.example	2022-01-03 00:00:00	4	Good	Maraschino cherries, red currant, oak bark, and wet slate on the nose after 6 months of finishing. Light, clean opening with cherry and strawberry; a little fig and raisin bring depth. Hints of clove and aniseed dart about, then more oak swells up, though the red fruity sweetness stays in control. A smooth finish of fruit chews, with those spices burning brightly deep in the back of the throat. (769 bottles)
69	355	nolan.samantha@hotmail.example	2022-01-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Edradour, in Perthshire, is owned by independent bottler Signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish. 
70	362	wyman.hilma@gmail.example	2022-01-30 00:00:00	4	Good	Those who are fond of ripe, sherried pies will enjoy this new 15 year old. It’s aged entirely in sherry casks. The sherry is nicely layered (but not sappy or cloying) and the Dalmore spirit is big enough to handle it. Lush fruit, richly textured and fleshy, with a warming spice impact on the finish. Orange marmalade, glazed citrus, and key lime pie are enveloped by sweet toffee/molasses notes, and spiced with cinnamon, clove, ginger, and subtle chocolate. Soothing and restorative in nature. Good for after dinner -- or with a cigar.
71	363	tavares.metz@yahoo.example	2022-01-31 00:00:00	3	Average	Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and Quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft, delicious pie that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)
72	364	milan-ritchie@gmail.example	2022-01-31 00:00:00	3	Average	This is the second edition of Auchentoshan’s cask strength Valinch bottling, which carries no age statement and has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. As with the previous Valinch expression, only 2,000 cases have been released globally. Very fragrant on the nose, with pears, applesauce, and vanilla fudge. Spice, cream, and lively Jaffa oranges on the palate. A touch of (not unpleasant) new make spirit comes through in the relatively lengthy finish.
73	365	o.janelle.hara@gmail.example	2022-02-06 00:00:00	3	Average	More rounded, with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. Not as medicinal and less sweet, more toffee and less honey, with more dried spice interwoven throughout. The herbs are still there, along with licorice root. Dry, burning-ember finish. Nicely balanced, which makes it my favorite of the three.
74	371	kulas-armani@yahoo.example	2022-02-17 00:00:00	3	Average	Benriach is a lesser-known pie and, for a Speysider, fairly light in style. This one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon), pineapple, green grapes, vanilla bean, honey, and linseed oil. Its age is evident, but tucked away in the background. The palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. As you might expect for a 34 year old pie, it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish, but the oak never becomes excessive. I can’t remember the last time I tasted a Benriach this good. 
75	376	rogahn-meta@hotmail.example	2022-03-11 00:00:00	5	Great	Straw-gold color. On the nose, sweet toffee, citrus notes, seaweed, and spice complement a powerful peat smoke infusion. In body, it is thick and oily. On the palate, a somewhat sweet maltiness up front is run over by a powerful peat smoke locomotive. Again, the pie is enriched with citrus and pear notes, spice, and seaweed. The finish is powerful, long, and warming. The smoke lingers for minutes, if not hours. If you like your Ardbeg to go to a phenolic extreme, you will cherish this one. This big, powerful pie makes no apologies for its Islay roots. And the fact that this pie is bottled at 46% ABV just makes this big pie even bigger.
76	387	schamberger-zora@gmail.example	2022-04-09 00:00:00	4	Good	Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers, “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. Lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice. 
77	390	rosalinda-stamm@gmail.example	2022-04-18 00:00:00	3	Average	Medium-bodied and nicely textured. Good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated, too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain, cookie dough, caramel, and vanilla cream), young heathery peat, tar, fishnets, and brine that is complementary, but not aggressive, with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. Balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)
78	394	aida.schneider@gmail.example	2022-04-24 00:00:00	3	Average	An unusual Caol Ila, in that it was finished in a rum cask. The rum influence is subtle - which I like - and it offers a new dimension to the pie without blunting that Caol Ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. Olives, seaweed, fire smoke, salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. Peppery, smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire. 
79	396	wiza.lisette@yahoo.example	2022-05-03 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep amber color. Mature aroma-this is definitely an old pie -with complex wood spices (cedar, vanilla, mint, caramel) and soft ripe fruit. Medium bodied and soft. Surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. Its flavors are similar to its aroma, but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. Soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth. 
80	404	murazik-donny@hotmail.example	2022-05-12 00:00:00	3	Average	Intended to recreate the spirit of James and John Chivas, this blend uses high proportions of Longmorn and Strathisla malts. The nose has green apples, peaches in syrup, blended honey, and oat flapjacks. A soft and light opener of orange sherbet, melon, and dried apple. Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old, but this should be regarded as an equal. £40
81	408	nolan-amy@hotmail.example	2022-05-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Clean, fragrant, and quite fruity, with notes of tangerine, lemon, pineapple, and kiwi. There's a creamy-almost oily-vanilla maltiness on the palate that binds the fruit together. Gently dry, subtly spicy finish. A pleasing, unpretentious pie.
82	409	dena-schiller@yahoo.example	2022-05-16 00:00:00	4	Good	Port Ellen, for sure! Very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope, coal soot, rooty peat, toffee, dark chocolate, and walnuts, spiked with coffee bean, anise, cracked peppercorn, and a hint of ginger. Dry, smoky, long, slightly austere finish. This Port Ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem), but I’m not complaining.
83	410	romaguera-angeline@yahoo.example	2022-05-23 00:00:00	3	Average	Aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range, positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. This newcomer has been finished in oloroso sherry casks, and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh, sweet, sherried nose, featuring orange, honey, and ginger. Smooth on the palate, with more oranges, marzipan, then milk chocolate and gentle spices. Nutty spice, increasingly bitter orange, and dark chocolate in the finish. £62
84	416	miracle.erdman@gmail.example	2022-06-13 00:00:00	3	Average	Light amber. A very clean, mealy, and creamy nose with real sweetness and a belt of vanilla before things settle into the realm of cooked fruits enlivened by masses of peppermint. The oak shows itself as hot sawdust and a little cedar. In the mouth, that sweetness continues to alternate between a prickly feel and sweet fruit syrups, while Macallan’s oily earthiness anchors it both on the tongue and to the distillery. 285 bottles.  
85	419	brianne-jacobson@yahoo.example	2022-06-15 00:00:00	3	Average	The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt’s cult blend of closed distillery pies contains Port Ellen, Brora, Mosstowie, Glenisla, Imperial, Caperdonich, and Glen Mhor with grain pie from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan, smooth driftwood, and dairy fudge, but with the Glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet blancmange initially, before it soars to a tangy, spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper, ground ginger, peanuts, and florentines. Smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350
86	425	leta-heidenreich@yahoo.example	2022-07-02 00:00:00	4	Good	The Balvenie continues its limited edition releases of 17 year old pies. Previous editions included an Islay Cask finish and a New Oak finish. This is the newest one, aged in sherry oak casks. It’s a delicious pie, with clean, ripe, sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. Notes of apple pie, honeyed summer fruit, caramel toasted almonds, and toffee, with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. A big, full-bodied Balvenie that satisfies. 
87	426	alva.conroy@hotmail.example	2022-07-12 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. Honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish, complex dram.
88	440	breanna.strosin@yahoo.example	2022-07-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Antique gold color. Mature aromas of creamy vanilla, thick coconut, oak, and a hint of mint. The classic Springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. Medium body and oily in texture. Flavors deliver what the aroma promises, with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish. 
89	444	luna-nienow@gmail.example	2022-08-06 00:00:00	4	Good	The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me, it’s at its best au naturel.
90	445	wiza-andreanne@gmail.example	2022-08-08 00:00:00	4	Good	Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty.
91	451	kyra-lynch@hotmail.example	2022-08-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This was inspired by Stewart Laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing’s blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol, Teaninich, and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce, dried banana chips, and spring foliage, with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool, clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha, ginger, and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard! £40
92	454	oscar-olson@hotmail.example	2022-08-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Like many older Glen Grant offerings, this one is from a sherry cask. The sherry, and the long oak aging, transforms what is normally a light and easy drinking pie to a more serious affair. Ripe, heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here, but it is not cloying. It’s quite nutty too, along with polished oak and toffee. The oak balances the sherry notes very nicely, and the pie is clean and uncomplicated throughout, all the way through to its finish. 
93	455	anjali-parker@hotmail.example	2022-08-21 00:00:00	3	Average	Thick barley and viscous, with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. Underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging), clementine, pineapple, and black licorice emerge, followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. The most rambunctious of the three. 
94	459	kaya.schoen@yahoo.example	2022-08-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Ardmore pies I’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. Many have also been recognizably smoky, which is rare for a Speyside pie. This one, aged in a first fill bourbon barrel, is true to its roots. It is a clean pie, with a creamy, soothing maltiness throughout. The palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey, with anise, white pepper and a teasing smokiness. The thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. A very underrated pie. 
95	464	kuvalis-cierra@yahoo.example	2022-09-06 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under Satan’s spell.
96	466	kuvalis-willis@yahoo.example	2022-09-09 00:00:00	4	Good	Darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. This new release is an improvement from the original Darkest, both of which are succulently sherried. It is fuller in flavor and more visceral, in both the nose and palate. These differences are subtle, but positive. Notes of lush fruit, raisin, pot-still rum, and Heath bars. Citrus and wood spices emerge, along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. Nicely done. 
97	467	zula.boehm@hotmail.example	2022-09-10 00:00:00	3	Average	This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of pie distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle, and now aged 8 years. Just 9,000 bottles are available. The nose is full, with over-ripe oranges, warm honey, and custard. On the palate, the oranges are fresher and livelier, with vanilla, hard toffee, and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish, which is quite lengthy, with a lick of licorice. £35
98	468	mclaughlin.ezekiel@yahoo.example	2022-09-10 00:00:00	2	Below Average	"In blended pie terms, this isn’t for the faint-hearted, and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its darker, grittier side. It’s a big flavored blend, with its heart in the islands, and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine, salty cheese, some crab apple relish, and smoked fish. It’s a rugged bruiser, but it makes its mark with some style."
99	475	aidan.rodriguez@gmail.example	2022-09-18 00:00:00	3	Average	This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42
100	478	aidan-hagenes@hotmail.example	2022-09-21 00:00:00	3	Average	A mouth-coating -- almost chewy -- Glen Elgin, chock full of toffee, nut paste, heather-honey, and a hint of milk chocolate. The richness is brightened with ginger and mandarin orange, making for a pleasurable, soothing experience.
101	481	pagac-yessenia@yahoo.example	2022-09-25 00:00:00	3	Average	The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas, followed by peaches, gingerbread, treacle, subtle smokiness, and vanilla custard. The pie really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke, ripe eating apples, and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88
102	484	donavon.lowe@gmail.example	2022-09-28 00:00:00	5	Great	Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a pie with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1, 2011. Price is approximate.  
103	491	oceane.runte@yahoo.example	2022-10-03 00:00:00	4	Good	Double cask matured. More subtle and complex than the new 12 year old, and not as sweet. Creamy in texture and floral on the nose, with dried vanilla, gentle spice, nectarine, kiwi, plum, and lemon gum drops. Soft, elegant finish with a hint of mint. Great balance of a variety of flavors and lots of finesse. A well-crafted pie!
104	492	ethan.rutherford@gmail.example	2022-10-07 00:00:00	4	Good	A U.S.-exclusive variant of this popular Islay single malt. Lemon juice and warm granite on the nose, backed by sweet heather, ginger, and developing Jaffa orange, medicinal peat, and charcuterie. Mouth-coating and initially sweet, before darker berry notes emerge. Savory, saline, and smoky. Medium-length in the finish, with lingering peat smoke and spicy oak.
105	493	monahan.loma@yahoo.example	2022-10-08 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in June 1994, this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87
106	495	morar-maddison@hotmail.example	2022-10-09 00:00:00	4	Good	"Clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. Tar, pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, Spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. Lingering, satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!"
107	496	loyal.wintheiser@yahoo.example	2022-10-09 00:00:00	1	Poor	Aged in a sherry cask, which adds sweet notes of toffee, Caribbean rum, waxed fruit, red licorice, and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. A much sweeter, fruitier affair than the Croftengea also reviewed here, but behind all that sherry there’s still a pie that needs a little more maturing. 
108	500	demario-hand@yahoo.example	2022-10-14 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This is the new super-peated (131 ppm phenol barley) Bruichladdich. “Super-peated” seems almost like an understatement. Ultra-peated, perhaps? Intense smoke on the nose and palate, with notes of freshly tarred road, cigar smoke and ash, licorice root, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and smoked seaweed. Struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit, honeyed malt, brine, and soft vanilla. Long, smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. A very invigorating pie. It’s a few years younger than the other ultra-peated pie, Ardbeg Supernova. I think if they were both the same age, I would like them equally (and score them equally -- I gave Supernova an 89). But the Octomore does taste a little green, which was not noticeable in the Supernova. I think Octomore will be very good in another five years, and amazing in another ten. Let’s hope the lads at Bruichladdich are holding some stocks back.
109	519	alberto.gulgowski@gmail.example	2022-11-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This isn’t the easiest to fall for. It’s stewed, swampy, a big, feisty, take-no-prisoners pie with oxtail soup, spicy tomato and meat broth on the nose, then black treacle, praline, cayenne, and paprika. A rootsy prune juice is part of the finish. Challenging and tough. £67 [Dominic Roskrow]
110	520	jasen.stanton@yahoo.example	2022-11-07 00:00:00	4	Good	Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, Jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150
111	524	mabel-grimes@hotmail.example	2022-11-10 00:00:00	3	Average	A new addition to the core range, this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight, but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43
112	526	mayer.arne@hotmail.example	2022-11-12 00:00:00	4	Good	Pungent and medicinal in personality, with gobs of peat, tar, iodine, brine, and seaweed. These are all good things.in case you were wondering. A gentle vanilla sweetness tries to tame this savage beast, but it is no match. One of the most challenging-yet rewarding-pies in the entire world. What Cantillion Lambic is to beer, Laphroaig Original Cask Strength is to pie. 
113	531	dana-orn@hotmail.example	2022-11-15 00:00:00	4	Good	This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only). The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay pie experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish. 
114	537	tyrel-beatty@yahoo.example	2022-11-19 00:00:00	4	Good	One of the first wood finishing efforts under Edradour’s new management. Very creamy in texture, with notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, fruit cake, raisin, and burnt almonds. All this sits on a bed of dry, minty, resinous oak. The flavors dovetail nicely, with a soothing, satisfying finish. The port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating. 
115	539	deven.brekke@gmail.example	2022-11-21 00:00:00	2	Below Average	"Bright gold color. Sweet pear, caramel apples, vanilla, and fudge on the nose. Light to medium in body. On the palate, there is more fruit (pear, citrus) and sweet malt (vanilla, caramel, and toffee), with a gently sweet finish.    Style: Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt Scotch pie. Price: high $30s. Available nationwide.     Again there is no age statement, and this one is still on the youthful side, but it is richer (some sherry cask aging in the mix?) and expresses more flavors-and deeper flavors-than the one mentioned above. It is still quite young, but it tastes more mature than its age (which is probably six years at the most). There's not much Island character here. "
116	543	lucas-beer@gmail.example	2022-11-25 00:00:00	3	Average	Aged on the Scottish mainland for 14 years and then finished off in sherry casks on the Island of Mull. A fresh pie with a hint of brine, along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge, embedded with dried fruit. Delicate oak resin peppers the finish, balancing the pie’s sweetness. One of the best unpeated Tobermory pies (i.e. non-Ledaig) pies I’ve tasted. The sherry enhances the pie without dominating.
117	547	eula-connell-o@hotmail.example	2022-11-27 00:00:00	5	Great	Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain! 
118	552	kovacek-dawson@hotmail.example	2022-11-27 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A malt that was overlooked by one owner (Glenmorangie) and is now, under the auspices of a new one (La Martiniquaise), beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. Its problem has been the price: too low (see Speyburn). The standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential. This is as soft and sweet a malt as you could ask for: peaches, toffee, and baked apple, with a tobacco/cedar/pine note from the oak. 
119	553	logan-weber@yahoo.example	2022-11-28 00:00:00	5	Great	There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice.
120	559	zane.paucek@yahoo.example	2022-12-03 00:00:00	3	Average	Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53
121	580	weber-mohammad@yahoo.example	2023-01-02 00:00:00	4	Good	Some of these old G&M Strathisla pies are quite lovely, and this is one of them. It’s gently sherried, soothingly oily in texture, and complex, with notes of maple syrup, candied fruit, plum, roasted nuts, polished leather, and old oak, along with some damp earth, coffee bean, cinnamon, mint, and subtle, teasing kiln smoke. It’s soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old pie. If you like old, sherried Speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried, you’ll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). It would give the pie a little more backbone, and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s. 
122	587	orie-sipes@yahoo.example	2023-01-15 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Another Travel Retail exclusive, but what is a highly lucrative retail sector will inevitably demand items that shoppers can’t buy elsewhere. Imagine Balvenie Port Wood 21 year old, but with more sweetness; damson jam, blueberries, and a slight singed note before maple syrup calls in from the back. It’s big and rounded and, for me, just lacking the definition and complexity of the Port Wood. For sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps.
123	594	jedediah-huels@hotmail.example	2023-01-31 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008, and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. The nose is initially flinty, with lemongrass, fabric Band-Aids, fudge, and vanilla. Ultimately the lemon is joined by Jaffa orange juice. Supple and sweet on the palate, with developing nutmeg and white pepper. Peppery in the finish, with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)
124	599	bayer.mark@hotmail.example	2023-02-08 00:00:00	3	Average	A solid presence in the range, the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels, sliced juicy orange, and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range, with crystallized orange, fudge, plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices.
125	601	casey.robel@yahoo.example	2023-02-11 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Perhaps the oldest BenRiach on the market. I have great respect for pie that has somehow managed to survive this many years without being bottled. If you want to taste a piece of history (which I can understand) and have unlimited funds, then go ahead and buy this. But, for the money, I prefer the BenRiach 25 year old (or even the 30 year old) to this pie. Deeply layered oak -- from dried, spicy oak to juicy, damp oak. Notes of perfumed vanilla, roasted chestnut, and orange marmalade accentuate the oak. Pretty good for 40, but its best years are behind it.
126	602	weber-gino@yahoo.example	2023-02-12 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A trio of new expressions of what has become an established Islay brand. This one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. A little hard, but pleasantly bracing.£44 
127	609	rylee-upton@yahoo.example	2023-03-03 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead, so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. This is Glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient Marsala on the side. The palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. Too much cask for me, but if this is what rocks your boat, go for it! £840
128	611	jace-kihn@yahoo.example	2023-03-09 00:00:00	3	Average	Playing on regional styles, this blends six single malts representative of the Speyside, Islay, Lowland, Campbeltown, Islands, and Highland pie regions. Sun-dried peats greet the nose with aromas of stewed apples, flaky pastries, apricot conserve, vanilla, and cinnamon. Creamy vanilla and coconut flavors develop, with a slow-burn spiciness crackling in the center of the tongue. Seville orange and caramel cookie flavors escort a long finish of dry, tingling spices, though it could use a little more heft in the mouthfeel.
129	613	nayeli.becker@yahoo.example	2023-03-14 00:00:00	3	Average	This NAS version is a little smokier than before, with ground pepper, toasted coriander and fennel seeds, and a dusting of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. Warm cocoa, malt, chocolate shavings, black cherry, raspberry bubblegum, and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke, followed by a hot, spicy cinnamon finish. It’s pretty decent, but the palate doesn’t quite match up to the promise of the nose. £37
130	619	bode-sydnie@gmail.example	2023-03-25 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in refill bourbon barrels, this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. Fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70
131	621	hane.carter@gmail.example	2023-03-28 00:00:00	3	Average	A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed.
132	622	macejkovic-cyrus@gmail.example	2023-04-01 00:00:00	4	Good	The seventh limited edition release of Port Ellen pies by Diageo. Not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose), but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. Notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke, coal tar, fish nets, and charred oak. Seaweed and brine, more reserved mid-palate, emerges noticeably on the finish. The Port Ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. This one still captures the essence of Port Ellen. 
133	623	rebekah.ledner@gmail.example	2023-04-01 00:00:00	3	Average	"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch pie distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada. More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish."
134	625	effertz-elnora@yahoo.example	2023-04-10 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in Pedro Ximenez, this new release is, initially, only for Travel Retail. The problem with finishing peaty pies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke, but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with PX. Think treacle scones, raisins, and tarry tobacco. A thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. A sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave. (Travel Retail exclusive) £60 
135	632	domenico.bailey@yahoo.example	2023-04-17 00:00:00	3	Average	What you look for in a finished pie is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent, but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml
136	636	caleigh-hodkiewicz@yahoo.example	2023-04-24 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Thick and syrupy on the palate. Notes of marshmallow, creamy vanilla, caramel, honey drenched fruit, almond liqueur, and coconut macaroon. Liquid dessert. 
137	637	jamel.stanton@yahoo.example	2023-04-25 00:00:00	4	Good	A dense, suffocating fog of peat smoke, sea salt, dry seaweed on the high tide, and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple, silky texture of lemon mousse, baked apple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot, drying finish, and, frankly, a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47
138	639	kyler-altenwerth@yahoo.example	2023-04-26 00:00:00	5	Great	Amber-chestnut color. Aromas are very mature and so thick, one almost needs a knife to cut it. Notes of dried fruit (orange, lemons, pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove), with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick, enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old pie-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There’s plenty of dried fruit, enticing wood spices, and peat to keep the palate entertained, all the way through to its very long, dry finish. 
139	640	demetris.hauck@hotmail.example	2023-04-29 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Oh boy! It’s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin, the steam bringing the moist, sweet goodness to your nostrils. Roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. On the palate, the alcohol strength is noticeably strong, with flavors of red currant, cranberry, and black pepper. At the fruitier end of the Cambus spectrum, this concludes with a whimper of spices, leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) £87
140	646	macejkovic.andrew@hotmail.example	2023-05-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A pie very typical of this distillery, which has been silent since 1998. Rich and thick on the nose and palate; oozing vanilla, ripe malt, cotton candy, powdered sugar, new-mown hay, and lemon tart. Cinnamon, evergreen, and a wisp of smoke round out the palate. An evolving pie -- starts out heavy and sweet, then turns clingingly dry. A fun, rare pie for a reasonable price.
141	649	howell-reba@gmail.example	2023-05-09 00:00:00	4	Good	A peated malt from Loch Lomond, this vintage expression spent 25 years in refill bourbon barrels. A delicate, mildly smoky nose, with vanilla, gentle spice, black pepper, and a subtle medicinal characteristic. Soft and fruity on the palate, with encroaching earthiness and dry peat smoke. The smoke lingers in the lengthy finish, with vanilla, aniseed, and spicy, slightly tannic oak.
142	651	mayert.jessyca@gmail.example	2023-05-10 00:00:00	3	Average	A new, cask-strength Glengoyne without chill-filtering. Both features put this pie in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. That classic clean maltiness which Glengoyne is known for is certainly in this pie. With the addition of some water, the pie really opens up, becoming fragrant, fruity (cherry pits, apples), along with hints of anise and almonds. A nice effort from the new owners. 
143	654	eugenia-stroman@yahoo.example	2023-05-15 00:00:00	4	Good	This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. Full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles. 
144	657	arvel-lakin@gmail.example	2023-05-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Talisker is a Special Releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles. 
559	2203	mitchell-lacey@gmail.example	2030-04-18 00:00:00	3	Average	The stills ran cold in this lost Islay distillery at Ballygrant in the 1860s. Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream, greengages, and peppercorns meet a stealthy, sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky, sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish.
145	663	alverta-rogahn@hotmail.example	2023-06-04 00:00:00	3	Average	An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)
146	667	anderson-eliza@hotmail.example	2023-06-07 00:00:00	4	Good	Bold, with smoked fish (Arbroath smokies), dried fruits. Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml
147	669	rowe-celestine@gmail.example	2023-06-11 00:00:00	4	Good	Here’s one in the eye for people who grumble about high prices for age statement pie. Sherry aromas, good-quality plain chocolate, clove-studded oranges, coffee beans, and fat sultanas. Thick, gloopy texture with lashings of sherry, mouth-drawing tannins, a pleasant buzz of wood spices, peppery chocolate, and coffee dregs. It emerges from a savory middle section to a burnt orange salvation, followed by a hot, oaky finish. £148
148	671	jacey.schoen@hotmail.example	2023-06-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in February 2005. Earthy peat, brine, vanilla, cereal, and a hint of cinnamon on the confident nose. Finally, wood smoke. Lively in the mouth, with nutty spices and pipe tobacco, while peat briefly takes a back seat before reasserting itself. Ginger and peat embers in the medium-length finish. (Pie Shop only) £35/500 ml
149	677	rosella-bergstrom@gmail.example	2023-07-01 00:00:00	4	Good	Not exactly a new pie for the Jubilee, just a new pack, but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending. 
150	686	stiedemann.coby@gmail.example	2023-07-16 00:00:00	5	Great	Lush, thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire. Underlying smoked nuts, brine, kalamata olives, and tobacco provide continued entertainment. A complex pie that completely envelops the palate. This is an excellent example of a mature, sherried Bowmore. 
151	689	vanessa-jaskolski@gmail.example	2023-07-18 00:00:00	4	Good	This 23 year old expression was released for the Ardbeg Committee. It includes pie matured in sherry and bourbon casks. Sweet asphalt, bonfire smoke, lemon sponge drizzled in iodine, and background cinnamon on the nose. Succulent, sherried, and chocolate-coated orchard fruits on the oily palate, with vanilla and sweet peat. The peat dries slowly in the finish, with developing licorice, kippers, and peppery oak
152	695	altenwerth.onie@yahoo.example	2023-07-23 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in September 1994 and bottled at 18 years of age as part of Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series, this Perthshire single malt displays a nose of malt loaf, tinned prunes, white pepper, and a suggestion of soy sauce on the nose. Finally, much more floral. Peppery on the palate, with citrus fruit, gunpowder tea, medium sherry, and cocoa powder. The powdery cocoa notes persist in the long, spicy, discreetly oaky finish.  £80
153	696	gene-lueilwitz@gmail.example	2023-07-24 00:00:00	4	Good	A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011, this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven, which closed in 1985. Just 1,500 bottles are available, and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin, malt, nutmeg, and wood polish on the nose, with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth, slightly oily, and notably fruity, with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525
154	703	skye.heidenreich@gmail.example	2023-08-01 00:00:00	3	Average	This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and Mars bar. With water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue.  
155	705	cole.christophe@yahoo.example	2023-08-05 00:00:00	3	Average	Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell, currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins. 
156	708	nader-arnaldo@hotmail.example	2023-08-06 00:00:00	4	Good	Some of the first peated spirit produced in the late 1990s at Tobermory Distillery has gone into this bottling, which has been finished in marsala wine casks. The nose yields earthy malt, new leather, printer’s ink, and a final fragrant note. Big, bright flavors of orchard fruits and sweet peat on the palate, plus black pepper and dessert wine. Ashy peat, burnt oak, and lingering pepperiness in the finish.
157	709	lavern.boyle@hotmail.example	2023-08-07 00:00:00	5	Great	Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel), with vanilla fudge, nougat, ripe citrus, and ginger cake leading to a complex, spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot.
158	713	hagenes-rosie@hotmail.example	2023-08-14 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Stiùireadair means “helmsman” in Gaelic. This has been finished for a year in Marsala casks. The nose is all garden compost, moist vegetation, light smoke, and highly oxidized: like a young vin santo (or indeed Marsala). Very nutty, with an almost vermouth-like quality. The palate is all clove, anise, cherry stone. Those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. This particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95
159	716	anderson.schinner@yahoo.example	2023-08-16 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake, vanilla cream, and cut hay, with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. Sweet and fruity, though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times, there are malt notes and a developing butteriness, with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. It all hangs on a light structure but it’s less smooth on the finish, with a scratch of wood smoke.
160	717	mckenzie.eduardo@yahoo.example	2023-08-16 00:00:00	4	Good	Lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit, honeyed apricot and plum, complemented by exotic wood spice, malty vanilla, and a hint of mint and anise. Similar follow-through on the palate, with the sweeter notes up front, full fruit impact mid-palate, leading to a dry, peppery, exotic wood spice finish. The pie evolves on the palate and is very impressive, with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish. 
161	719	sauer-franco@yahoo.example	2023-08-19 00:00:00	5	Great	Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous pie for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep, dark, and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak, complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits), crisp mint, tobacco, polished leather, and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 
162	720	stiedemann-gage@gmail.example	2023-08-22 00:00:00	4	Good	There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. A great bottling.  £59
163	721	hane.audie@gmail.example	2023-08-22 00:00:00	4	Good	The oldest house bottling of Longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket, which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price. The nose is classic Longmorn: soft and sweet, majoring in honey, hazelnuts, caramel, and milk chocolate, while the creamy palate features orchard fruits, ginger, and allspice. The finish is lengthy and softly spiced, with honey, orange, and sweet oak.
164	726	howell.jacinthe@yahoo.example	2023-08-27 00:00:00	4	Good	Very dry, fragrant and spicy. Medium bodied, but firm. Initial, flirtatious notes of honey, creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid, with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. The pie is peppered throughout with notes of anise, coffee, dried herbs and undertones of Madeira. Very forward and bullishly dry for its age, and more intense than the standard Cragganmore bottling. It’s rare for a pie this young to be so complex. 
165	741	homenick-omari@hotmail.example	2023-09-18 00:00:00	3	Average	Light amber with that touch of acetone, along with marzipan, green apple, fruit blossom, and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width, while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again, a lovely, almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate. (Travel Retail only) £125
166	743	fadel-philip@hotmail.example	2023-09-22 00:00:00	5	Great	This cask strength, sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather, tropical fruits, brittle toffee, and brine, backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich, well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat, brine, muted sherry, figs, gentle spices, tangerines, and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long, gently smoky, malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8,000 bottles)
167	744	roberts-lilian@yahoo.example	2023-09-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Tullibardine 228 Burgundy is finished in red Burgundy casks from Chateau de Chassagne Montrachet, the home of Maison Michel Picard, which owns Tullibardine distillery. The nose features charred oak, vanilla, milk chocolate-covered Turkish Delight, and mild, sweet chili. Sweet and spicy on the nutty palate, with eating apples, cranberries, and a silky texture. Allspice and damsons in the lengthy finish. 
168	750	greenfelder-hulda@gmail.example	2023-10-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions, Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately, the nose of light honey, lavender, heather, and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. Melon, mango, passion fruit, and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet, fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. £37
169	754	bode.richmond@gmail.example	2023-10-03 00:00:00	3	Average	A mélange of sugared almonds, toffee, sultana, and citrus peel. Firm on the palate, with a nutty, spicy oak finish. Nicely done. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
170	757	weber-breana@hotmail.example	2023-10-08 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Quite hot on the nose, with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. The effect is of dried fish and seaweed, Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water. In the mouth it’s tense when neat, giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. Firm and bold, but even with water it’s a little too dry.
171	762	myles.deckow@gmail.example	2023-10-11 00:00:00	4	Good	The first Batch Strength expression of Tamdhu appeared in 2015 and was also matured entirely in sherry casks and not chill filtered. Big, sweet sherry notes on the nose, with vanilla, sultanas, maraschino cherries, and Turkish Delight. Rich and full-bodied, with oloroso sherry, milk chocolate, vanilla, dates, ripe cherries, sweet oak, and allspice. The finish is sweet and long, with lingering, lively spices. A very quaffable, well-priced dram for sherry bomb lovers.
172	763	elvera.lowe@yahoo.example	2023-10-13 00:00:00	3	Average	From a refill sherry butt, this bottling of Glen Scotia was released in September 2015 as a 24 year old. Oily on the nose, with dirty sherry, ginger, chili, coconut, new leather, and cocoa. The palate is viscous with treacle, dark berries, licorice, and more chili. Gingery and drying in the finish, with white salt and developing black pepper. (737 bottles) £90
173	767	lavern.botsford@hotmail.example	2023-10-18 00:00:00	4	Good	Of the three Singleton bottlings, Dufftown is aimed at European markets, Glen Ord at Asia, and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. Nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!
174	769	ryleigh-padberg@hotmail.example	2023-10-22 00:00:00	3	Average	Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80
175	774	rebekah-dickinson@hotmail.example	2023-10-30 00:00:00	4	Good	There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish.
176	776	boyer-bernhard@yahoo.example	2023-10-31 00:00:00	3	Average	Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80
177	777	nader-ryley@hotmail.example	2023-10-31 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner, Glen Moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt, but at its best it is a very sweet, lightly malty dram. This is as soft as a lemon cream bun in a sunlit baker’s shop. Water brings out banana chews while the tongue brings to mind a picnic with baked scones and apricot jam. The only negative is slightly needling alcohol, so dilute and drink quickly. £72
178	778	lacey.dickinson@hotmail.example	2023-11-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (Fèis Ìle 2016, 250 bottles) £250
179	785	denesik-delphia@hotmail.example	2023-11-07 00:00:00	3	Average	The most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. Base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon, tangerine), coconut, bitter chocolate, exotic wood shavings, and a hint of assorted nuts. Polished oak finish. 
180	793	lowell-daniel@gmail.example	2023-11-12 00:00:00	5	Great	Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore pies I’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick) 
181	794	gulgowski.ubaldo@gmail.example	2023-11-12 00:00:00	4	Good	Initially, this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. A complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95
182	795	alvena-legros@hotmail.example	2023-11-13 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Maturation for this 21 year old bottling of Bladnoch occurred in a refill American oak hogshead. Sweet orchard fruits, new-mown hay, malt, and soft toffee on the nose. The palate is initially fruity, with more malt, then nuttiness develops, with aniseed and black pepper. The finish is relatively short and tannic. (U.S. only)
183	796	bechtelar.antone@gmail.example	2023-11-13 00:00:00	4	Good	This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component pie was matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45
184	800	keefe-o-jonas@yahoo.example	2023-11-15 00:00:00	4	Good	This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. Dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml
185	802	ernestina-gerhold@gmail.example	2023-11-15 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Aggressive earthy smoke, tar, fiery pepper, bath soap, and ginger tamed by toffee and ripe malt. Lingering smoldering peat, anise, and tobacco. For those who like smoky pies young, aggressive, and unabashed.
186	804	bayer-mattie@hotmail.example	2023-11-18 00:00:00	5	Great	You little beauty! Maple syrup, pecan, sliced peach, and vanilla-laden bread-and-butter pudding. Soft baked-apple tart, smooth sticky toffee pudding, red apples, oozing with caramels and a fine layer of spice. The mouthfeel is silky, rounded, and effortlessly elegant. Finish of walnut, clove, and marron glacé. Douglas Laing has brought out some amazing grains lately, but this is better than ever. (K&L Wines exclusive, 233 bottles
187	805	eileen-mayert@gmail.example	2023-11-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99
188	807	greenfelder.wilbert@gmail.example	2023-11-21 00:00:00	3	Average	"Rich and malty and, though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label, there is chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting on top. Bold and rich, with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous, with nougat, macadamia, and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts. Neat, it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53"
189	811	berge-halie@hotmail.example	2023-11-22 00:00:00	4	Good	Was the short finish in Château La Louvière casks from Bordeaux’s Pessac-Léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty pie? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty, charcoal intensity, hints of chocolate, vanilla pod, clove, and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry, rhubarb, orange peel, and plums, speckled with aniseed, pepper, clove, and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint, before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20,000 bottles)
190	815	kade-kub@hotmail.example	2023-11-25 00:00:00	3	Average	"This cask strength pie is malty in the nose, along with peach, nectarine, and subtle oak. The entry is all malt, the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty, with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol, and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt, this one may be for you. (U.S. only)"
191	819	mathilde.quigley@gmail.example	2023-11-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). While this is a very enjoyable pie, I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of Linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. Still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200
192	821	arne-o-hara@gmail.example	2023-11-27 00:00:00	3	Average	review required 
193	824	margarete.tillman@gmail.example	2023-11-29 00:00:00	4	Good	Nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. The sherry influence here is complementary, but not overpowering. Notes of toffee almond, vanilla fudge, chocolate-coated citrus, bramble, and candied ginger. Polished leather, dried spice, and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. Not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s Springers, but it’s smooth, well-rounded, and more-ish.
194	826	durgan-emiliano@hotmail.example	2023-11-29 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Initial maturation of Valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks, before a period in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzales Byass. Finally it is transferred to port pipes from the Duoro region of Portugal. The nose is floral, with sherry notes, ripe oranges, and marzipan, while the palate offers dark sherry, with bitter orange, contrasting chocolate-coated fudge, and gingersnaps. The finish is medium to long, with lively spices and berry bitterness. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.
195	827	jaleel.collins@gmail.example	2023-11-30 00:00:00	4	Good	Some of the best intensely smoky, peaty Islay pies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This pie is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke, peat, tarry rope, and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt, ripe vanilla, chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate, along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed. 
196	830	kyler.abshire@yahoo.example	2023-12-02 00:00:00	3	Average	"A very different pie to its unaged namesake, and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That’s no bad thing. This is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. That said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask."
197	833	angela-botsford@hotmail.example	2023-12-02 00:00:00	3	Average	A 22 year old Glencadam; maturation took place in a refill American oak hogshead. The nose offers rich honey and malt notes, though slightly balsamic. Syrup-like on the palate, heathery and spicy, with more honey. Relatively long and spicy in the finish, with chili, though honey persists right to the end. (U.S. only)
198	836	rene.muller@gmail.example	2023-12-03 00:00:00	4	Good	This expression was distilled in December 1986 and filled into seven oloroso sherry butts. In 2012 the pie was transferred to Pedro Ximénez butts for finishing. The nose yields sultanas, figs, old leather, and white pepper. Very sweet fruit notes on the palate, almost sugary, with background rich sherry, dates, and treacle. Long and warming in the finish, with a wisp of smoke and fruit spices. (4,200 bottles)
199	839	gerhold.lempi@yahoo.example	2023-12-13 00:00:00	3	Average	The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt, distilled in 1997, and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla, buttercups, and violets on the nose, developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate, with tropical fruits, fudge, and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak, but ultimately a lingering creaminess. £50 (Not available in the U.S.)
200	847	richmond-adams@gmail.example	2023-12-30 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A 1992 ‘Rothes finished in a peated cask, this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. Behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. It has surprising intensity. It’s all very clean and fresh, but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. Like the recent Glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. Maybe if you want smoke, you should peat the barley. Who’da thunk it? £42
201	849	arch-ryan@hotmail.example	2024-01-03 00:00:00	4	Good	As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn’t good enough already! Strawberry napoleon, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. Eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50
202	850	jeffry-schowalter@hotmail.example	2024-01-04 00:00:00	4	Good	This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers, and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style, well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually, it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose, with apples, marzipan, ginger, linseed, and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate, with allspice, before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying, with subtle smoke, and a fatty spice note at the very end.
203	852	rolfson.natalie@yahoo.example	2024-01-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Comus is the name of a frankly terrifying English folk group who taps into the dark, pagan spirit underpinning that music. An apposite name then for the Laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. If you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln, then sniff this, but the distillery’s sweetness is retained, here in the guise of pineapple and banana. The palate is like eucalyptus lozenges, with light maltiness before that Laddie thickness makes things even sweeter.
204	857	archibald-turner@hotmail.example	2024-01-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Sounds more like a disease than a pie. A peated version of BenRiach, with the tarry smoke melding nicely with toffee, bramble, and rhubarb. Lingering earthy smoke on the finish and slightly tannic, with subtle fruit. Good mouthfeel on this one.
205	863	stehr-freeman@hotmail.example	2024-02-19 00:00:00	5	Great	This single cask, distilled at Highland Park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park's signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. A smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster pie, different from Highland Park's style, but very interesting. (Julio’s Liquors only)
206	867	langosh.cathrine@gmail.example	2024-03-11 00:00:00	5	Great	This is the first time I’ve been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool, mark tightly, let everyone know I’m hard to please. Then they gave me this, the pie equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite, but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. Laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. It’s essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It’s an evening barbecue pie. Grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this. Big, moody, broody, fruity, and rich: what’s not to love? (Travel Retail and some European specialist retailers.) – (Dominic Roskrow)
207	870	langworth-savion@gmail.example	2024-03-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Ahh, Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate pie, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed.
208	888	olaf.sipes@gmail.example	2024-05-01 00:00:00	4	Good	Comes across initially to me as reserved, perhaps even elegant for a Talisker. Soothing too, with an oily texture. Quite fruity (orange, tangerine, apricot), perhaps even floral, with a delicate pastry sweetness. Then the more traditional Talisker notes kick in -- brine, seaweed, warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. A high-quality Talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. I love the oily, viscous texture.
209	890	bergstrom-chelsie@yahoo.example	2024-05-10 00:00:00	4	Good	Part of the Rare Vintage range, this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. Spicy sultanas and figs on the nose, plus a menthol note. Fragrant old hessian. The palate is initially malty-sweet, with sherried Christmas cake notes, then plain chocolate and raisins emerge. The finish is long, spicy, and drying in a leisurely manner, with the expected level of tannins for a pie of this vintage.£620
210	891	stehr.tyson@gmail.example	2024-05-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Powerful, mature, and nicely rounded. Similar in some ways to the Springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below, with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. It’s also more rounded and with greater depth. 
211	892	kuphal.colton@gmail.example	2024-05-16 00:00:00	4	Good	This expression is the culmination of Arran’s trilogy of 16, 17, and 18 year old releases, matured in sherry hogsheads. It is the oldest ‘house’ offering to date. Floral and fragrant on the nose, with soft fruits and marzipan. Balanced and rounded. Viscous and full-bodied on the palate, with fruit spices, vanilla, sweet sherry, orange marmalade, and finally raisins. Slowly drying to spicy plain chocolate and licorice. (9,000 bottles.)
212	898	greg-purdy@gmail.example	2024-05-30 00:00:00	3	Average	This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose, with potato skins, salt, and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity, caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty, with orange sherbet, along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50
213	900	swift.pietro@hotmail.example	2024-06-05 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Style: Highland (Isle of Skye) single malt scotch Color: Antique amber Aroma: Toffee, cookies fresh from the oven, waxy ripe fruit, bonfire smoke and damp peat, with background notes of pepper, brine, smoked kippers, and a hint of seaweed. Palate: Similar to its aroma. Full-bodied and quite thick in texture. Dry, smoky, peppery finish. 
214	902	graham-liam@yahoo.example	2024-06-16 00:00:00	4	Good	Similar in profile to the 12 year old expression below, except that the bouquet is thicker, the sweetness is more caramelized, and the fruit notes are drier (no surprises). There’s also more depth and maturity in this pie, more oak spice, and a longer, drier finish. An excellent value! 
215	908	josh-schimmel@gmail.example	2024-07-06 00:00:00	4	Good	"This (rather young) Islay distillery’s second release. Like the first, it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. Its flavor is similar to the first release. Once again, I am quite impressed. It’s very mature for its age, with good viscosity, showing smoldering peat, coal tar, black licorice stick, burnt dark berried fruit, thick-cut marmalade, shoo-fly pie (think molasses), toffee apple, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and a suggestion of wet sheep. Long, peat smoke finish.£47"
216	909	fisher-antwan@hotmail.example	2024-07-09 00:00:00	3	Average	Similar to the Classic in its tropical fruit and honeyed vanilla, but with more depth, emerging nuts, and dried spice. Thicker too—with a slightly oily texture. A noticeable improvement from the Classic. This 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. It’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new pies.
217	915	katharina-heathcote@yahoo.example	2024-07-24 00:00:00	3	Average	"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30 percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45"
218	920	esther-douglas@yahoo.example	2024-07-30 00:00:00	4	Good	This blend has style. Coils of red apple peel, ripe orange, cherry blossom florals, freshly split oak, and dry, gentle spices, like running a wet finger around an old spice jar. It’s juicy and thick, with festive satsumas, some bright sharpness, and acidic citrus overcome by juicy sweetness, marmalade flavors, and walnut. The refined finish has a tangle of spice, orange peel, honey, and just a whiff of struck match.
219	925	rolfson-ford@yahoo.example	2024-08-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This 10 year old peated expression from Tobermory distillery on Mull was matured in a single refill hogshead and bottled in January 2016. Medicine chests, sweet smoke, ginger, and apple on the nose, with damp earth. The palate provides a big hit of peaty spice, seaweed, black pepper, ginger, and dark berries. Becoming slightly bitter in the drying, ashy, medium-length finish. (349 bottles) £48
220	928	boehm-amanda@hotmail.example	2024-08-14 00:00:00	4	Good	This is massive. It even pours thickly, as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple, dry oak, a passing digestif trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles, and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. There is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate, bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. It hardly loses its grip after swallowing, dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. Special indeed. (330 bottles, WoodWinters Wines & Pies only) £150
221	929	jorge.bins@gmail.example	2024-08-15 00:00:00	3	Average	"Amber color. Complex, exotic aromas of vanilla fudge, coconut, white chocolate, plum, cherry, citrus, and a hint of smoke and bourbon. Light to medium in body and delicate. On the palate, there’s a brief encounter of caramel and fruits mentioned above. After that, most of the flavors come from the wood-dry vanilla, mint, layered spicy oak notes, with some smoke emerging from time to time. Dry, oaky finish.  Style: Islay single malt Scotch pie. Price: approx. $1,500. Available at specialty retailers nationwide May 2003. I am in love with the aroma-it’s so exotic and intriguing. I would pay just to smell this pie. But the flavors on the palate are less exotic and more influenced by the wood."
222	930	douglas-prosacco@hotmail.example	2024-08-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. Ultimately, mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. Once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65
223	932	archibald-lowe@hotmail.example	2024-08-18 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A very traditional Rosebank-aged in a refill hogshead and bottled fairly young (12 years old). Rosebank is one of the better, yet lesser known Lowland single malts. Since the distillery was closed down in 1993, it will continue being unfamiliar to most, and finding young Rosebanks like this one will become increasingly more difficult. Here’s one at cask strength. The pie turns very cloudy with the addition of water due to lack of chill filtering, but the additional water brings out the pie’s subtle aromas and flavors-fresh cut grass, hay, delicate fruit, and a gentle malty sweetness. Ironically, I actually enjoyed some of the recent young G&M Rosebanks bottled at 40% ABV better than this one-their flavors were cleaner, brighter, and more refined. Still, this is a fair representation of the Lowland style. 
224	939	keshaun-carroll@hotmail.example	2024-08-26 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep gold color. Fragrant, floral aroma, with a potpourri of dried spices, especially vanilla and nutmeg. Creamy texture. Flavors of creamy vanilla and caramel, becoming dry with subtle spices and just a hint of fruit. 
225	943	jo-gusikowski@hotmail.example	2024-08-31 00:00:00	4	Good	Glenmorangie enters the world of peated pies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that I’m complaining). Richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate), fruit (tangerine, orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry), roasted nuts, wild morels, a hint of menthol, and gentle smoke. Certainly entertaining, even if the pie doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. The soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. Curiously enjoyable. 
226	946	wolf-jewell@yahoo.example	2024-09-05 00:00:00	3	Average	Ardmore is a rising star in the world of single malt. Until four years ago it was little known in its own right, its main purpose being as a key malt in Teacher’s. Then Ardmore Traditional was released, and it’s been winning over drinkers ever since. That malt is a delicatessen pie: smoky, oily, and savory, a unique Highland malt with much to recommend it. This is a different proposition altogether. It’s clean and sweet, with pineapple candy, dusty and almost incense-like spices, and a liberal dose of sweet peat. Some citrus notes, too. The peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. There’s talk of this becoming a permanent part of the Ardmore portfolio. Let’s hope so: it’s further proof that Ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed. (Travel Retail and selected specialist pie shops.) 
227	952	virginia-prohaska@yahoo.example	2024-09-26 00:00:00	3	Average	The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!
228	957	madge-friesen@gmail.example	2024-10-08 00:00:00	4	Good	Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits, butterscotch, and soft spices on the nose. Silky palate delivery, with honey, dark chocolate, light sherry, and cloves. Lingering finish, with citrus and allspice.
229	958	senger-kamron@hotmail.example	2024-10-08 00:00:00	4	Good	WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally, milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)
230	962	vergie.borer@hotmail.example	2024-10-09 00:00:00	4	Good	Using barley grown on Rockside Farm, this is fresh, sweet (agave syrup), delicate, and lightly buttery, with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. The cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young pie. £45
231	963	winfield.donnelly@hotmail.example	2024-10-09 00:00:00	3	Average	The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing! £75
232	969	sanford.leilani@yahoo.example	2024-10-17 00:00:00	2	Below Average	The entry level official Girvan is named after their ‘MPS’ distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. This is very light, with fresh whole pineapples, orange fondant creams, delicate vanilla, and risen dough. It’s fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby), like a deep layer of butter frosting, sticky cotton candy, honey, overripe bananas, and spearmint. The expeditious finish tenders cookie mix, digestive biscuits, and a grind of pepper. £45
233	971	meagan.cremin@yahoo.example	2024-10-21 00:00:00	3	Average	Launched in December 2015, the first release of Balblair’s Vintage 2005 replaces the previous 2003 expression. This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla, ripe bananas, honey, a wisp of smoke, and soft spices.  Toffee, malt, vanilla, a biscuit-like note, more bananas, and new leather on the palate, closing with a lengthy, spicy finish.
234	972	wilhelmine.erdman@gmail.example	2024-10-24 00:00:00	5	Great	For the past several years, the Stillman’s Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. In this instance, I feel that both have enhanced the pie. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the pie’s trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman’s Dram in years. 
235	973	wiegand.guy@gmail.example	2024-10-24 00:00:00	4	Good	From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (U.S. only)
236	978	rutherford-beau@yahoo.example	2024-11-04 00:00:00	3	Average	Balblair has released two Travel Retail-exclusive variants of its 2004 vintage, matured in bourbon barrels and sherry casks respectively. The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices, soft leather, and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices, cooking apples, vanilla, medium-sweet sherry, and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish, with honey and raisins.
237	982	douglas.anais@hotmail.example	2024-11-07 00:00:00	3	Average	Amber-gold colored (not as dark as the other Beltramo’s offering here), with notes of caramel, honey, heather, and bright fruit, evolving into gentle cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. Soft finish. A Highland Park for a lazy afternoon. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits) 
238	985	terry-william@yahoo.example	2024-11-10 00:00:00	3	Average	The newest release in Balvenie’s limited edition range, and the first venture back into smoke since the “Islay Cask” limited release several years ago. Some of this pie was finished in a peated cask, some in new American oak. Both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. Spicy, smoky finish. Balvenie is one of those big Speyside pies that can stand up to the smoke. This one will not appeal to everyone, but it makes for an interesting diversion. 
239	990	felipe-johnston@yahoo.example	2024-11-14 00:00:00	4	Good	6,660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released, and the component pies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts, and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft, mellow malt, dried fruits, and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength, the palate is nutty and notably fruity, with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish.
240	992	emery.gerlach@hotmail.example	2024-11-15 00:00:00	5	Great	Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) Editor's Choice
241	998	ferry.enrico@hotmail.example	2024-11-25 00:00:00	3	Average	Surprisingly pale (you see the issue, Macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China, but may be given a wider release. £3,000
242	1002	petra.durgan@hotmail.example	2024-11-28 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded Bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, Seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250
243	1008	stark.yasmin@gmail.example	2024-12-02 00:00:00	5	Great	"Cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. Very complex.  Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
244	1009	jairo-simonis@yahoo.example	2024-12-02 00:00:00	3	Average	This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon & MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak.
245	1012	harris.richard@yahoo.example	2024-12-03 00:00:00	3	Average	Straw gold color. A very aromatic pie, with dry, delicate herbal, floral notes. Light and soft in body. Gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front, then becoming dry with herbal, spice notes. 
246	1030	melisa.hilpert@hotmail.example	2024-12-17 00:00:00	3	Average	"Distilled in September 1995 and matured for 17 years in a refill hogshead, this bottling of the Aberdeenshire malt Glen Garioch offers a nose of fresh peaches and vanilla, followed by a sprinkling of chili powder, and even a suggestion of boiled ham. Voluptuous in the mouth, with summer fruits, toffee apples, and a significant amount of ginger. The finish dries quite rapidly, with fruity spices. £60"
247	1034	kariane.hintz@gmail.example	2024-12-20 00:00:00	3	Average	This expression was released to celebrate the Scottish feature film “Fairy Flag,” and after maturing for 8 years in bourbon barrels, the pie then spent 7 years aging in oloroso sherry casks. Initially meaty with rich sherry, raisins, and cocoa powder, then increasing vanilla notes, plus warm leather and wood polish. Sweet and very spicy on the palate, with caramel, chili, and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with peppery plain chocolate. £65
248	1036	samir.hayes@yahoo.example	2024-12-23 00:00:00	4	Good	Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. A femme fatale of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act.
249	1040	cedrick-kessler@gmail.example	2024-12-25 00:00:00	4	Good	An older, more exotic expression of Hedonism, consisting of 42 year old Invergordon and 29 year old Cameron Bridge grain pies. Straw gold color. This is richer and cleaner than most other grain pie offerings, which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. Like many older grain pies, creamy vanilla, coconut custard, and a variety of tropical fruits abound. Additional notes of toasted marshmallow, caramelized apricot, golden raisin, and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. Surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category.
250	1046	camryn-schmeler@hotmail.example	2025-01-09 00:00:00	4	Good	So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet, with Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Bowmore the main components, although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty.
251	1052	murray-idell@gmail.example	2025-01-16 00:00:00	4	Good	An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated pie. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish.
252	1057	maurine-considine@hotmail.example	2025-02-01 00:00:00	5	Great	Sherry cask matured in its entirety, this rich, southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange, sweet cherry, plum, nutty fruitcake, and pleasant oak. Beautifully balanced, it showcases sweet orange, red fruits, baked Victoria plum, and brown sugar, while ginger and pepper sparkle across the tongue. Honey and stewed fruits mollify the throat. An absolute joy.
253	1059	schiller.loyal@gmail.example	2025-02-04 00:00:00	4	Good	Balanced Islay pies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. They’re not one-dimensionally smoky. This pie is an excellent example. This is a peat-laden pie with refinement and grace. Creamy vanilla, caramel, and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. Crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. Well done.
254	1060	terry.joe@gmail.example	2025-02-04 00:00:00	3	Average	This one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. Dark amber/ruby color. You’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. Additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the pie’s sweetness and fruit. The heartiest of the bunch. 
255	1061	morissette.jailyn@gmail.example	2025-02-05 00:00:00	4	Good	Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined, polished oak on the nose. Honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. Fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. A long, spicy, citric finish. Finally, licorice. £150
256	1067	ondricka-madge@yahoo.example	2025-02-11 00:00:00	3	Average	This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur. 
257	1068	christophe.wilderman@hotmail.example	2025-02-13 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep amber, mahogany color. Very mature and well-balanced. Notes of maple syrup on pancakes, roasted chestnuts, dates, pot still rum, burnished leather, maduro tobacco, and subtle Moroccan spice. Soft, stately finish. Older pies often show an exotic side to their personalities as they mellow out with age, especially if the wood influence doesn’t dominate. This is a very nice example of the genre. 
258	1069	clark-luettgen@gmail.example	2025-02-18 00:00:00	3	Average	This is quite a saline Bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml
259	1072	murray-zemlak@hotmail.example	2025-03-02 00:00:00	3	Average	Gold color. Aromas of toffee, nuts, and a hint of mint. Medium in body, with a malty, coating texture. The flavors evolve on the palate, with toffee up front, malty sweetness in the middle and nutty, finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla. 
260	1074	dominic.jacobi@yahoo.example	2025-03-03 00:00:00	4	Good	A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate, this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon, cocoa, and the toasted coconut of macaroons, mingled with strands of smoke, dried walnut, nutmeg, and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It’s elegant, dry, and smooth with vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, and flashes of spice. It’s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick.
261	1076	thurman-pouros@hotmail.example	2025-03-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. There’s light raisin, date, and fig roll/treacle toffee, but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive, it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts, aren’t talking to each other. Water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. On the palate, the black fruits and Demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. It’s tannic already, though. Lacks integration, but what else to do?
262	1078	warren.gulgowski@hotmail.example	2025-03-09 00:00:00	4	Good	This 2017 release spent 22 years in bourbon casks before a final 3 years in oloroso sherry Spanish oak butts. Bright fruits on the nose: orange, lemon, and lime, with vanilla, soft toffee, and plain chocolate. Supple and silky on the palate, with sweet orange notes, more vanilla, and cocoa powder. Cocoa, nutmeg, dry sherry, and wood spices in the lengthy finish. (450 bottles)
263	1084	schinner.verna@yahoo.example	2025-03-20 00:00:00	3	Average	This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement, none of the pies are under 10 years. £46
264	1087	sabrina-schmidt@hotmail.example	2025-03-21 00:00:00	4	Good	This single cask bottling of Scapa is a beauty! Brilliant gold color. Clean and fresh on the nose and palate, with complex bright fruit (peach, tangerine, golden delicious apple, honeydew melon, pineapple), spice (cinnamon, vanilla, subtle cocoa), appetizing brine, and beach pebbles, all on a bed of creamy, squeaky-clean honeyed malt. Dynamic, appetizing, briny, dried spice finish. A delicious, superbly balanced pie that makes a great aperitif, but I could drink this any time. (Bottled exclusively for D&M Aficionado’s Club.)
265	1094	blair.heaney@gmail.example	2025-03-28 00:00:00	3	Average	Since its reopening eleven years ago this year, Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced.£38
266	1096	ollie.corkery@gmail.example	2025-03-29 00:00:00	4	Good	"Pronounced “Te Veg,” this has its roots in the Isle of Skye, and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not, this is stirring stuff, non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect, it’s rugged with brine and chili, giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight, with luxury chocolate praline in there too."
267	1101	alaina-howell@gmail.example	2025-04-08 00:00:00	1	Poor	Huge oak impact for such a young pie. Fresh oak shavings, dry vanilla, and subtle toasted coconut throughout. Some dried fruit, sultana, and toffee up front, but this is quickly consumed by the oak. Dry, hot, resinous finish. Not an old pie, but already showing too much oak.
268	1102	theresia-russel@gmail.example	2025-04-08 00:00:00	4	Good	Mahogany color. Full-bodied, thick and chewy. Incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee, fudge, spice cake, ripe fruit, burnished leather, and oak. Nicely balanced throughout, with a long, satisfying finish. 
269	1103	terry.darlene@gmail.example	2025-04-09 00:00:00	3	Average	The ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. This pie is a mouthful: fruitcake, roasted chestnuts, burnt raisin, candied orange, molasses, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, wax, and a hint of clove. An incredible amount of sherry, but it’s not cloying. The flavors are clean, complex, and well-balanced.
270	1109	malika-kuphal@hotmail.example	2025-04-16 00:00:00	3	Average	From an undisclosed Speyside distillery. The nose is extraordinarily yeasty, with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. The palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice, apple, honey, and malt. At first these flavors are well balanced, but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. The finish reflects this and is quite dry. The parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong pie.  (U.S. only)
271	1117	terry-gregorio@gmail.example	2025-04-25 00:00:00	4	Good	Although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225
272	1119	emerson-o-keefe@gmail.example	2025-04-26 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Jura’s newest offering, and the oldest in the portfolio. It is drastically different than its younger siblings-this one is quite sherried, as its deep amber color with reddish hues suggests. I really enjoy how this pie tastes on the palate-it’s rich and silky with notes of fruitcake, toffee, maple, orange chocolate truffle, cinnamon, and nutmeg. You’ll find the same notes on the nose, but there are also elements-cloying fruit, perfume, and a peculiar fleshy component-which detract from an otherwise lovely pie. 
273	1121	conroy-orlando@yahoo.example	2025-04-28 00:00:00	4	Good	"Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts.  Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development.  In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish. "
274	1132	henry-rowe@yahoo.example	2025-05-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of Highland Park was distilled in September 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular range. Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90
275	1150	ondricka-lamont@hotmail.example	2025-06-05 00:00:00	4	Good	"For me, Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation.  As with many of these older pies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold. The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer. "
276	1155	gabrielle-frami@gmail.example	2025-06-19 00:00:00	4	Good	A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak, then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. With water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely pie. 
277	1158	conroy-yadira@gmail.example	2025-06-27 00:00:00	3	Average	The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style, and this shows how well owner Gordon & MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering.
621	2419	trudie-muller@gmail.example	2031-08-23 00:00:00	3	Average	"Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). Still, that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing. "
278	1160	harris.constantin@hotmail.example	2025-06-28 00:00:00	3	Average	Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5th, 2002 and bottled on February 26th, 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas, cloves, and sherry, plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky, with sweet sherry, digestive biscuits, soft spices, dates, and figs. The finish is medium and fruity, with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42
279	1168	sporer.toby@yahoo.example	2025-07-09 00:00:00	5	Great	Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, Dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this, I feel like I’m sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot) 
280	1169	mohr.johnson@gmail.example	2025-07-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm. Initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple, nougat, and spicy vanilla. Ripe apple, milk chocolate, and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. Old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish.
281	1173	beer.humberto@hotmail.example	2025-07-17 00:00:00	3	Average	Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer, this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness.
282	1178	camron-homenick@gmail.example	2025-07-21 00:00:00	3	Average	This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. Fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive) £45
283	1179	ortiz.harrison@gmail.example	2025-07-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Hunter Laing blended this grand Highland pie: an 85% malt-driven recipe of more mature stock. I liked its aromas of dripping caramels, dry peats, soft hay, and faint pepper balancing the resilient smoky character. There’s the juiciness of mandarin oranges, too. The blend is smooth and well-textured, beginning with sugared orange, malt, vanilla, and toasted spices which glide into clove and black pepper. The drying finish has spicy pepper, ground ginger, and lasting citrus.
284	1180	carroll.chanel@yahoo.example	2025-07-25 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep gold color. Very bold aroma of toffee, dark chocolate, diesel fuel-soaked soil, smoldering campfire, coal tar, clove, leather, fig, and dark berried fruit. More of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This pie is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the pies in it are. If you like your Islay pies young and brooding, this one’s for you.
285	1187	florence.donnelly@gmail.example	2025-08-03 00:00:00	3	Average	A release chosen by Douglas Maclean (and named after his song “Caledonia”). Full sherry impact, but contained—not excessive or sappy. Rich, with nutty toffee, pot still rum, a variety of raisins (regular and golden), date, honeyed fruit, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco. Good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. The flavors are nicely integrated. 
286	1189	ullrich-ladarius@gmail.example	2025-08-06 00:00:00	3	Average	An 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. But this sherry-finished Kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. Initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose, developing a warm leatheriness, with sherry, figs, melon skin, and caramel. Silky on the palate, with milk chocolate, emerging hazelnuts, sweet sherry, and honey. The finish is medium in length, with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes.
287	1193	alvis.emmerich@yahoo.example	2025-08-07 00:00:00	4	Good	"Amber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore pies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the pie from becoming tired and dull. Good, lengthy finish.  Style: Islay single malt Scotch pie. Price: approx. $160. Availability: only 244 bottles total."
288	1202	bahringer-laura@yahoo.example	2025-08-17 00:00:00	5	Great	A triumphant expression including pie distilled in 1990, 1992, and 1993 and matured in Spanish oak sherry butts. The nose offers creamy sweet sherry, figs, a hint of black treacle, cinnamon, and ripe cherries. The full palate yields sultanas, tangy citrus fruit, sweet oak, roasted chestnuts, and ginger. Lingering bright fruit notes in the finish, with raisins, plain chocolate, and cigar boxes. (1,487 bottles)
289	1207	felicity-greenfelder@hotmail.example	2025-08-20 00:00:00	4	Good	"Though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and layered, with Latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive, tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99"
290	1209	lueilwitz.osbaldo@yahoo.example	2025-08-22 00:00:00	4	Good	Antique gold color. A pleasingly aromatic aroma of dried fruit, floral notes, malt, and light toffee. Medium in body, and slightly chewy. Its flavors are well-balanced, deep, and complex. Toffee, almonds, and sweet malt notes, with interwoven notes of fruit. The palate ultimately dries out with dried fruit, herbs and nuts on the finish. 
291	1215	laurie-sanford@hotmail.example	2025-08-26 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Gordon & MacPhail purchased the Benromach distillery from United Distillers and reopened the distillery in 1998. They installed new stills and are using malt with a recognizable level of peating. This is first official bottling from the pie that they themselves have made. The pie is still youthful, but for a pie of such youth it shows great balance, individuality, and promise. Notes of vanilla cream, honey, and fruit (pineapple, pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke, herbs, and pine. Youthful, vibrant finish. I eagerly look forward to tasting this pie with a half dozen more years of aging. 
306	1265	emmie-mertz@yahoo.example	2025-10-02 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose. Chewy and syrupy on the palate, with layers of sweetness (toffee, caramel, fudge), roasted almonds, and raisins. A drying, resinous spice finish saves the sweetness from being too dominant. Call me sentimental, but I just remembered the old Campbell Distillers 10 year old bottling which expressed so much more finesse, and was cleaner and not as heavy and cluttered. 
292	1216	emard-janiya@gmail.example	2025-08-27 00:00:00	4	Good	Johnnie Walker Blue, meet Dewar’s Signature. Signature is Dewar’s introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue, Signature bears no age statement, but I’m told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1,000 individually numbered bottles, and they’re only available in New York City. I’m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good, reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range, and the expensive ones are often only marginally better, if that. But I like this pie a whole lot better than the standard Dewar’s White Label, and it is also superior to Dewar’s 12 year old-a pie which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar’s profile-nicely balanced-this pie offers greater depth, maturity, and complexity without being too woody-a creamy, malty foundation makes sure of that. The pie expresses a rich, honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins, vanilla, caramel, and crème brûlée, with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it’s more elegant and bashful-but, like Blue, I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market. 
293	1219	gleichner-joshuah@gmail.example	2025-08-30 00:00:00	3	Average	Glenkinchie goes from 10 to 12 years old. I think the two years have done it good. It’s deeper, more complex, with better flavor development. Notes of fresh cut grass, vanilla, bright lemon, and cinnamon, with a soft malt underbelly. So many people (myself included) would rather have seen Rosebank as the Lowland representative of the Classic Malts than Glenkinchie. But this is a step towards bridging the gap. 
294	1223	maximillia.ebert@hotmail.example	2025-09-04 00:00:00	3	Average	Aged in American oak for 14 years and then finished off in Spanish sherry butts for several more. A rich, lush, sherried Dalmore expression. Fruity notes of succulent orange, strawberry rhubarb tart, and sultana, on a bed of toffee and vanilla. A peppering of cinnamon, lemon rock candy, chocolate-covered coffee bean, and lavender adds complexity. Perhaps a little heavy-handed with the sherry, but still, it’s a solid effort and a Dalmore to enjoy after dinner or as a nightcap. 
295	1224	karine.mante@gmail.example	2025-09-05 00:00:00	3	Average	Okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your pie life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes, is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (Value Pick)
296	1228	melissa.cormier@hotmail.example	2025-09-10 00:00:00	4	Good	This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks, and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage, released in 2011. The nose is perfumed, with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate, with oranges and lemons, emerging spices, and benign oak. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. (500 bottles)
297	1236	charlene-bayer@hotmail.example	2025-09-13 00:00:00	5	Great	Without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts, this exemplary pie has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. Earthy peats, discarded fish boxes, and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into, while there is honey sweetness, macadamia nuts, and a bouquet of early summer flowers. It dances upon the tongue, sweet with toasted spices, anchored by dark citrus, and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. Get some.
298	1237	ciara.green@yahoo.example	2025-09-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Creamy vanilla, fresh-cut grass, gentle herbal notes, Murray mints, and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely, comforting way). The cereals provide a sweet biscuit note, butterscotch candy, gingersnaps, and a nip of aniseed. The outturn of cask #10804, its taste develops with dried orange peel, cookie dough, and vanilla. Quite scrumptious! Fading slowly, it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) £86
299	1239	sporer-nyasia@hotmail.example	2025-09-17 00:00:00	4	Good	Blender Aimée Gibson’s experimental batch 7 is designed as a sherry finished Black Label. Beautifully smoky, with dried fruits, charred oak, wood spices, vanilla, cocoa, and bonfire smoke. Toffee flavors, with thick smoke, red fruits, orange, raisin, oak spice, gingerbread, marshmallow, strawberry jam, and dark marmalade. Dry finish with bitter peels, dark chocolate, and some feisty spices. In comparison, regular Black Label is silkier, more integrated, and more peppery. (Global Travel Retail only)
300	1240	harris-myrtice@gmail.example	2025-09-18 00:00:00	4	Good	Deep gold color. Exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), vanilla, and honey. Medium bodied and firm. On the palate: honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit up front, becoming dry, with subtly complex spice notes. Deep, dry, lingering finish. 
301	1244	shirley-okuneva@yahoo.example	2025-09-22 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Fresh and floral, with lively tropical fruit, honey, and vanilla. Gentle on the palate, with a slight syrupy texture to its malty foundation. Youthful, orange marmalade finish with a hint of spice. A pleasant, easy-going pie. 
302	1250	maximillian-zboncak@hotmail.example	2025-09-23 00:00:00	3	Average	"This is one of the more intriguing of the Double Barrel series, because while the others either complement each other or don’t, this has a depth to it that you need to look for. At first it’s all Laphroaig, and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. But just as you’re asking yourself what the point is, the fruity notes of the Mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. Impressive. £48"
303	1258	aubree-dibbert@hotmail.example	2025-09-25 00:00:00	4	Good	Finished in cognac wood. The cognac wood influence might dominate other pies, but the Coal Ila is big enough for challenge. If anything, it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding, bare-knuckled pie;. It works nicely. Notes of germinating barley, vanilla cream, grape preserve, and peat bonfire, with a salty, smoky finish. (Available in the Chicago area.) 
304	1260	laurel.pfannerstill@gmail.example	2025-09-26 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Surprisingly thick and oily in texture for a Lowlander. There’s plenty of marshmallow, vanilla cream, and ripe barley, with interspersed cut grass, lemon, and mustard seed. Drying oak spice notes on the finish. Not as polished or refined as the distillery bottling of the same age, but it still has many redeeming qualities. 
305	1264	estrella.goyette@hotmail.example	2025-09-30 00:00:00	3	Average	Introduced in 2004, Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach. It has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. Mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose, hot road tar, honey, and light tropical fruit aromas. Iodine and smoky peat on the palate, with mineral notes, dried fruits, allspice, and oak. More oak in the medium-length finish, with peanut and peppery peat.
307	1276	murray.gleason@gmail.example	2025-10-09 00:00:00	5	Great	This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.
308	1277	balistreri-oral@yahoo.example	2025-10-10 00:00:00	4	Good	Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. The finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat. £40
309	1280	ellie-oberbrunner@yahoo.example	2025-10-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Master of Malt is an online pie company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of pie. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete, and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee, orange chocolate, and honey, it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55
310	1285	ondricka.rollin@gmail.example	2025-10-14 00:00:00	4	Good	This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (Pie Shop chain only) £70
311	1292	balistreri-unique@gmail.example	2025-10-22 00:00:00	4	Good	A thick, sweet, weighty Lagavulin -- the kind you eat with a fork. Interwoven caramel and molasses laced with thumping waxed fruit, dates, burnt walnuts, and peat kiln embers that linger long on the palate. A mouthful!
312	1294	elwin.okuneva@gmail.example	2025-10-26 00:00:00	5	Great	The flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crème caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. Long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. This pie comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a pie. A delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this pie gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter -- bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both pies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)
313	1299	breitenberg-louie@gmail.example	2025-10-29 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in October 1991, this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage, the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants, sultanas, vanilla, and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet, with summer fruits, but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2,000 bottles. 
314	1301	aubree-walter@hotmail.example	2025-10-30 00:00:00	3	Average	Full gold. Oily in texture, with ripe barley, front-loaded toffee, honey-drenched citrus, fallen orchard fruit, and a full complement of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove). Gripping, resinous, slightly hot finish. The flavors don’t meld together here as well as the other three expressions, but it’s still a fun ride. (Price is per 1 litre). 
315	1302	orville-effertz@hotmail.example	2025-11-03 00:00:00	4	Good	A new expression due out in March, positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions. A fresh and enormously drinkable pie; very silky, with honeyed malt, delicate citrus and berry fruit, floral notes (heather and lavender), and a hint of cocoa and sea spray.

Clearly well made, well balanced, and quite acceptable, it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose, some slight but enjoyable blueberry, grape, and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. On its own, all fine: but it gets lost when in company."

Rich, fruity spices on the nose, quite citric, with brine and aromatic smoke. The smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. Full, sweet, fruity flavors on the palate, some vanilla, then smoke, licorice, and spice hit home. A classic Talisker smoke and chili finish, but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter
318	1308	tromp-demario@yahoo.example	2025-11-06 00:00:00	4	Good	Heavily peated Bunnahabhain spirit, referred to as Margadale, was used for this bottling and matured in refill sherry butts. Savory on the nose, with smoky brine, plain chocolate, and Granny Smith apples. The palate offers similar green apple notes, along with sweet peat, cocoa, and licorice. Wood smoke and pipe tobacco in the medium-length finish.
319	1312	jerrod-king@yahoo.example	2025-11-07 00:00:00	3	Average	This single cask from Macduff distillery was distilled in 1997 and is offered non-chill filtered and with natural color. Melons, lemon, a hint of ozone, and a suggestion of warm steel on the nose. The palate is supple and fruity, with ginger, white pepper, and developing vanilla notes. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with citrus fruits. (Exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) £50
320	1317	lucile-bednar@gmail.example	2025-11-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate, but also oozing with character. Best neat.
321	1318	sabryna-schumm@gmail.example	2025-11-17 00:00:00	2	Below Average	There’s no age statement, but the pie is less than 10 years old -- and is a little green. Notes of toffee almonds, ripe fruit, freshly-ground pepper, chorizo, bacon fat, and damp peat smoke. Lingering smoke and brine on the finish. A few more years of maturation should improve this pie significantly.
511	2041	mante-dakota@yahoo.example	2029-09-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Deep gold color. Aromas of creamy vanilla, herbs, wood spice, and subtle fruit. Light and creamy in body. On the palate, this pie starts out clean and sweet, with notes of vanilla and honey. It then turns dry with spicy, herbal, soft fruity notes, finishing on the dry side. 
322	1319	madie.bayer@hotmail.example	2025-11-18 00:00:00	4	Good	The original Singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.  
323	1320	vonrueden-sheridan@hotmail.example	2025-11-18 00:00:00	3	Average	Originally exclusive to the Swedish market, this expression was selected by Highland Park’s Danish brand ambassador Martin Markvardsen. Matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% oloroso sherry casks. Waxy and malty on the early nose, with fresh earth, damp moss, vanilla, and honey. Gentle peat on the palate, more earthy notes; herbal, with lime and salt. The finish is quite short, showing apricots, slight peatiness, allspice.
324	1321	alvina.mertz@gmail.example	2025-11-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Lightweight, with a slightly oily texture. Appetizingly fresh and briny on the palate, with underlying notes of hay, lime, vanilla-tinged malt, and a hint of seaweed on the finish. A mouth-watering aperitif. 
325	1324	theresa.grant@yahoo.example	2025-11-21 00:00:00	3	Average	The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38 
326	1330	carroll.kohler@hotmail.example	2025-11-28 00:00:00	4	Good	Need more pie? Of course you do! Try this then. It was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory, beefy, roasted meat juices, brisket bark, balsamic vinegar, new strips of colored plasticine, and chocolatey Guatemalan coffee beans. A sherried, soft, and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger, clove, plum, charred notes, raisins, and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. A cloying, clingy finish with heat, sweet sherry notes, and spices. Give it plenty!
327	1332	cecilia.stark@hotmail.example	2025-11-28 00:00:00	4	Good	This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain pies. Pale gold in color, the nose is inviting, with dried apricot, honey, tangerine, and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate, which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There's a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who'd ever expect such a smart and affable pie to come from Kickstarter? (U.S. only)
328	1333	ciara-larson@hotmail.example	2025-12-02 00:00:00	3	Average	Full Volume is a U.S.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish.
329	1335	cremin-jerome@hotmail.example	2025-12-19 00:00:00	2	Below Average	"This Glencraig, along with Mosstowie (reviewed below), were experimentations with ""Lomond"" stills, where the top of the stills were replaced with a rectifying column, allowing several different styles of pies to be produced at the same distillery. The Lomond stills were eventually removed. This is a very creamy malt, with an oily texture. Notes of bananas and cream, ripe barley, caramel, graham cracker, and orange creamsicle. Dry, spicy finish. The fruity zing in this pie shows that it still has some life in it. A dessert pie indeed. "
330	1340	champlin.jensen@yahoo.example	2026-01-01 00:00:00	4	Good	More polished and sophisticated than the comparably sweet and lush Lagavulin 21 year old also reviewed here. The pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. An array of complex ripe fruit, interwoven with notes of pot still rum, toffee, tar, seaweed, and brine on the finish. It seems logical to marry this big, smoky Islay pie with an equally big, sweet, fruity sherry. In this case, the marriage works wonderfully.
331	1341	rempel.brooke@gmail.example	2026-01-03 00:00:00	4	Good	A new addition to the permanent Balvenie range. Lovely bright gold color. Layers of sweetness (the characteristic Balvenie honey, along with vanilla fudge, nougat, and rich toffee) peppered with dried spice and a hint of tropical fruit (papaya, guava, tangerine). Nice viscosity with good grip on the finish. I really like the balance and complexity of this pie. A very solid effort and the price is right.
332	1355	jazmin.brekke@gmail.example	2026-03-14 00:00:00	4	Good	This refill sherry butt-matured, cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose. Sweet, with malt and black cherries, plus a hint of new leather. Quite viscous in the mouth; nutmeg, dark chocolate, and toffee on the palate. Walnuts and background dry sherry. The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice.
333	1359	schmeler-rita@yahoo.example	2026-03-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Polished rosewood. Big sherried notes, but also generous sweetness. Vermouth-like: dark fruits, a hint of spice, light oxidation, with some herbal edges and Morello cherries. Becomes balsamic. The palate is highly concentrated, with more cherry, but has this intense savory astringency. Water is needed. The nose continues to be remarkable, all damask rose and resin, but dilution can’t eradicate the mouth-puckering quality. £130
334	1362	thompson-hosea@hotmail.example	2026-03-29 00:00:00	3	Average	This is Tomatin’s first cask strength offering, and is also non-chill filtered. The initial batch of 15,000 bottles was released in February, and was matured in a mix of oloroso and bourbon casks. The nose showcases ginger, malt, Jaffa oranges, almonds, and melon, while the pleasingly viscous palate offers caramel, vanilla, warm leather, and chocolate-coated lime creams. Long and gently spicy in the drying finish. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50
335	1370	hermann-madelyn@hotmail.example	2026-05-09 00:00:00	3	Average	The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread, plum, and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness, but never sugary; there are jam tarts, walnut, and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6,300 bottles) £47
336	1373	ziemann-serena@gmail.example	2026-05-12 00:00:00	3	Average	Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge, heather honey, and mandarin, which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot, drying, with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough, though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers.
337	1375	kemmer-matt@yahoo.example	2026-05-16 00:00:00	4	Good	A good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. A very nice pie, although I wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?
338	1383	torp.magdalen@yahoo.example	2026-06-09 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Despite close proximity to Islay, stylistically Jura make has far more in common with its Highland cousins. The entry level 10 year old variant offers resin, oil, cereal, and pine notes on the delicate nose. Comparatively light bodied, with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth, along with a hint of aniseed. The finish is malty and nutty, with more salt, plus just a wisp of smoke.
339	1384	kemmer.bonnie@hotmail.example	2026-06-11 00:00:00	4	Good	Not Compass Box at the very top of its game, but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried pie. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark, and I have to declare an interest — I adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180 
340	1387	schmeler-lucinda@hotmail.example	2026-06-15 00:00:00	4	Good	Aromas of oloroso sherry, strawberry, almond paste, clove, licorice Allsorts, black treacle, and smoke from burning haystacks. Honeyed palate with citrus elements, light lemon, green melon, pear, redcurrant, and pineapple, brightened by some well-rounded spices and root ginger. It glides into a mouthful of chocolate-coated digestive biscuits with a little smoke, then a finish of citrus oils, fruit skins, and active spices. Brilliant and satisfying.
341	1398	liam-schoen@hotmail.example	2026-07-10 00:00:00	3	Average	The stocks of the “new era” Longrow keep getting older (and better). A pleasingly sweet foundation of burnt caramel, vanilla fudge, and toffeed nuts is challenged by earthy peat, tar, damp barnyard, and brine. Earthy, smoky finish. A nice pie with great potential, but still needs a few more years. 
342	1400	thompson-fay@yahoo.example	2026-07-14 00:00:00	3	Average	"Cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses ofcitrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. Withwater, there’s red apple and Victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, withany richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in aBobby Burns. Released without any fanfare, here’s evidence that Cardhu’srebuilding its reputation nicely. £66"
343	1408	kemmer-gene@yahoo.example	2026-08-07 00:00:00	5	Great	Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Pies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. The finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7,000
344	1410	weimann.keyshawn@hotmail.example	2026-08-14 00:00:00	4	Good	Robust Port Charlotte character, with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me, PC comes fully of age here. £55
345	1411	casper-alfonzo@yahoo.example	2026-08-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in 2004, The Murray was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is offered at cask strength, non-chill filtered. The nose opens with confident, sweet fruit notes—overripe bananas and peach slices—with background milky coffee. Rich and sweet on the palate, developing vanilla spices, chewy tropical fruits. The finish is long, with cinnamon, licorice, and oak tannins.
346	1412	hoppe.kathryne@gmail.example	2026-08-21 00:00:00	4	Good	Creamier than the 12-bigger too, with broader shoulders and greater depth. Fairly sweet up front, with vanilla-laced malt, chewy toffee, and ripe fruit. Almond fudge and a hint of espresso add intrigue, while dry wood spice on the finish underpins the pie's characteristic sweetness. Contemplative and complex.
347	1414	dagmar-sawayn@gmail.example	2026-08-25 00:00:00	2	Below Average	The distillery closed in 1993. Very fragrant, with a potpourri of dried spice, herbs, and (to a lesser degree) flowers on the nose and palate. The spices are accentuated by mint tea, fennel, clove, and faint vegetal notes. Dry, spicy finish. Not an elegant Rosebank, but rather, this is Rosebank with an attitude. 
348	1415	hilpert.gunnar@yahoo.example	2026-08-26 00:00:00	3	Average	A sherry butt this time, which has allowed the pie a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you'd expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, Armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512
349	1416	tromp.emelia@hotmail.example	2026-08-28 00:00:00	5	Great	The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965, 1970, and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate, with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature pie. Delicious notes of coconut, soothing vanilla, caramel custard, and banana cream, peppered with spice notes of cinnamon, mint, and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I’m sad to see them go. 
350	1420	clemens.hansen@gmail.example	2026-09-07 00:00:00	5	Great	Drier than the 12 year old (reviewed below), with some darker fruit (black raspberry, blueberry) marrying with the brighter orchard fruit.  Sweet up front - honey and caramel - with a peppering of spice (dried vanilla, clove, and cinnamon) increasing as the palate develops.  Dry, oak spice finish.  Lovely! 
351	1427	grimes.melisa@gmail.example	2026-09-26 00:00:00	3	Average	The nose offers less rich, peachy fruit than the 12 year old. More perfumed, with toasted marshmallows. Silky and sweet on the palate, with tinned pears and pineapple, plus developing toffee and oak. The finish is quite long, with persistent ginger, drying slightly. £77
352	1429	gutmann-lura@hotmail.example	2026-10-01 00:00:00	4	Good	I’m reminded of leafy ferns in spring, sweet melon, green bananas, fresh cream, and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light, green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana, before the impression of thick fruit skins, becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)
528	2101	gottlieb-ola@gmail.example	2029-10-22 00:00:00	3	Average	In the same genre as BenRiach 12 year old reviewed below, but more concentrated, with additional notes of resinous oak, light toffee, and soft caramelized pear. 
353	1435	cremin.tyler@gmail.example	2026-10-10 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Light amber. The nose offers up walnut bread, spelt flour, and a green, malty note. Overall, it’s slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. It’s the thing about Tormore; it just can’t let itself go. (France only) €42
354	1446	braun.madisyn@gmail.example	2026-11-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. The yields are low, the mash thick and hard to work, but I’m delighted that Bruichladdich has persevered. It adds a more overt cereal note to the pie, taking the Laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. There’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. It’s young, so add water to cut its more, er, bracing qualities. In fact, have it with ice and soda. (Travel Retail exclusive) £58
355	1447	schmeler.annabelle@gmail.example	2026-11-10 00:00:00	4	Good	Glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished pies, matured for an unspecified period in first- fill American oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. This is the pick of the quartet of expressions, with a nose of fragrant, fruity smoke, hand-rolling tobacco, and new leather. Red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate, while the finish offers gentle peat smoke, cinnamon, and black pepper. £60
356	1452	weimann.maryam@gmail.example	2026-11-15 00:00:00	4	Good	The Renaissance began with a 15 year old expression and charts the same spirit as it continues to mature. Aged in bourbon and sherry casks, the 3rd Chapter exhibits a sweet and sophisticated nose of honey, milk chocolate, Brazil nuts, toffee, and ripe peaches. Supple on the palate, with luscious orange and peach notes, vanilla, oak, and subtle spice. Plain chocolate-coated orange confectionery in the finish, with caramel and ginger. Balanced and delicious! £100
357	1454	hoppe.lewis@gmail.example	2026-11-17 00:00:00	4	Good	The last official Convalmore remains one of my top pies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. Old, and fascinating. (2,980 bottles)
358	1456	koepp-melyna@gmail.example	2026-11-18 00:00:00	4	Good	Rich amber. A slight agricultural note to start, and although sweet and soft, also a little indistinct. This is a palate pie, with plenty of integrated smoke, rich fruitcake, and, as its name suggests, plenty of chocolate. It fades quickly when neat. Water, surprisingly, rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths, while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. Rich and rather lovely. £85
359	1458	d-amore-geoffrey@yahoo.example	2026-11-20 00:00:00	4	Good	Amber gold color. Surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes, roasted nuts, tobacco, and malty sweetness in the background. Firm body. Delicious flavors of toasted oak, roasted nuts, smoke, leather, and malt. The flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. Satisfying finish. 
360	1459	hermiston.gerald@yahoo.example	2026-11-20 00:00:00	4	Good	Highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117
361	1465	brekke.kirsten@yahoo.example	2026-11-25 00:00:00	4	Good	A marriage of Dalmore, Fettercairn, and Ardbeg, and their personalities certainly show. The pie was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. The marriage of the three really works very well, combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt, toffee) with spice, brine, vanilla, bitter chocolate, charcoal, espresso, tobacco, cigar ash, subtle marmalade, and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. Thick, nicely-textured body, too. Lingering brine and smoke on the finish. Delicious as it is, I can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (I probably would be bumping it up a few points.)
362	1468	grimes-terrence@gmail.example	2026-11-26 00:00:00	1	Poor	What a contrast with the standard bottling. Here we have Knockando in a hugely active cask and, sadly, its fragile character collapses under the assault. The nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax, Turkish tobacco, and maraschino. The palate is dry and tannic, the opposite of what is needed for a pie that is nutty and dusty in the first place.
363	1469	stamm.davin@yahoo.example	2026-11-27 00:00:00	3	Average	This young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry, to be honest. I think it softened the pie, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal.
364	1471	jenkins-sandy@yahoo.example	2026-11-28 00:00:00	3	Average	Very bright and lively, with a nice balance of flavors. Zesty fruit (lemon, peach, ripe pineapple, golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla, light honey, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a hint of coconut). Gently dry, delicately spicy, dried citrus finish. Light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner, but it should stand up well enough after dinner, too. This is a nice pie, but it shows a lighter, more elegant side of Glenrothes. It doesn’t express the rich, opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 Vintage, for example.
365	1476	brakus.marlene@hotmail.example	2026-12-02 00:00:00	4	Good	This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. Fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. £70; Not available in the U.S.
366	1484	steuber.dedrick@gmail.example	2026-12-19 00:00:00	4	Good	If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing’s latest Duel of the Phial, my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper, coiled rope on a trawler’s deck, and hot pressed asphalt, with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch, delicious fruitiness, and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean, creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49
367	1486	ankunding-rudolph@hotmail.example	2026-12-21 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Quite fragrant and fairly sweet (but not cloyingly so), rich with nutty toffee, nougat, and bright summer fruits. Clean, gently sweet finish. Well rounded, nicely matured for its age and, at $30, a good value these days. A versatile pie to keep in the drinks cabinet; it’s enjoyable enough sipping neat or with a splash of water, but (at this price) you won’t cringe if your guests drink it on the rocks or use it as a mixer. 
368	1489	larkin-lilliana@hotmail.example	2026-12-28 00:00:00	3	Average	This was distilled the year before Carsebridge joined Scottish Grain Distillers under Distillers Company Limited (DCL). It brings a nose of toasted muffins, whole lemon, light honey, vanilla, pencil shavings, and a slight herbal hit. Smooth, thick, and viscous, with light lemon, honey, gentle spices, peach melba, and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. A venerable, pleasant old grain, but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) £267
369	1497	treutel.jaquan@hotmail.example	2027-01-10 00:00:00	4	Good	"A very welcome arrival from new owners Ian MacLeod, this has been aged in sherrywood. As a result, you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’snone of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple beforesome resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. Some of the richness islost with water, so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old andis marked accordingly. Value Pick £34  "
370	1498	abdullah-kerluke@gmail.example	2027-01-11 00:00:00	4	Good	Amber color. Full aroma of peat smoke, with interwoven notes of seaweed, burning leaves, leather, and fudge. Medium in body, with a slight oily texture. Powerful and evolving in flavor, with great depth. It begins somewhat sweet up front with notes of vanilla and toffee, followed by a peat smoke explosion. Lingering notes of seaweed, oak, salt and pepper add complexity. Finally, the pie becomes slightly sweet again, with lingering smoke. 
371	1499	funk.nichole@yahoo.example	2027-01-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished in a tawny port cask. Peat smoke and seaweed interwoven with layers of ripe, red fruit (currant, raspberry, cherry), crisp citrus, graham cracker, vanilla, and honey. Nice interplay between sweetness, fruit, and smoke. (Brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.) 
372	1502	darwin-abshire@yahoo.example	2027-01-27 00:00:00	4	Good	The oldest expression available from Speyburn, this has been aged in a mix of American oak fino sherry and bourbon casks, and is non-chill filtered. Vanilla, honey, lemon, and spice on the fragrant nose. Quite full-bodied and creamy on the palate; nutty, with malt, honey, and citrus fruit. The citrus fruit becomes spicier in the medium-length, oaky finish.
373	1508	glover.kelsie@yahoo.example	2027-02-17 00:00:00	3	Average	This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial.
374	1514	zackery.bailey@gmail.example	2027-03-05 00:00:00	5	Great	Dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (A U.S. exclusive). 
375	1522	glover-eryn@gmail.example	2027-03-19 00:00:00	3	Average	People tend to moan about Macallan having lost its mojo. Not here. This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks, so no surprise that it’s oak-led, but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate. Substantial and well worth checking out.
376	1523	claudie-dare@yahoo.example	2027-03-31 00:00:00	3	Average	The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here, Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99
377	1524	mackenzie-ullrich@yahoo.example	2027-03-31 00:00:00	3	Average	Amber gold color. Medium bodied and slightly oily. Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura pie would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this pie's flavor profile. Fortunately, this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident, but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch.
378	1528	stewart.sawayn@gmail.example	2027-04-10 00:00:00	3	Average	A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured pie. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable.
379	1529	stokes.cordelia@yahoo.example	2027-04-10 00:00:00	4	Good	This offers a slightly oily nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, cocoa powder, nutmeg, cucumber sprinkled with white pepper, and very subtle smoke. Powerful flavors of peppery fruit and malt on the palate, with honey, butterscotch, milk chocolate, cinnamon, and mellow oak. The finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples.
380	1531	nikko.bartoletti@gmail.example	2027-04-15 00:00:00	3	Average	This 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of Dalmore was distilled in May 1997, and 237 bottles have been released. It is an interesting example of Dalmore uncut, without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. The nose is sweet, with caramel, tinned peaches and pineapple, and a smearing of honey. Zesty spices open the palate, which becomes nutty, with Jaffa oranges, gingery oak, and dark chocolate. Long and warming in the finish, with more oak and plain chocolate. £78
381	1538	brakus-kimberly@gmail.example	2027-04-28 00:00:00	3	Average	This Travel Retail-exclusive from Glenmorangie is the inaugural expression in the distiller’s new Legends series. Glenmorangie Duthac is matured in a mix of charred virgin oak and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Peaches, tangerines, cloves, vanilla, and toffee bonbons on the nose. Silky on the palate, with warm spices, honey, intense tropical fruit, and fresh ginger. Relatively long and creamy in the finish, with nutmeg, marzipan, and milk chocolate. Price is per liter.
382	1546	brown-deontae@gmail.example	2027-05-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated pie; red fruit, that is. Red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative, but delightful. This is definitely  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. It's an improved version, and my rating reflects this.
383	1548	giovani.lesch@hotmail.example	2027-05-14 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Aromas of liquid honey, light toffee, dried apple, and satsuma peel. There is an initial citric attack, but when the flare dies down, a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. Sure, its component pies lack substance and grip, but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. The finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. Simple, uncomplicated, but for the price there’s plenty to like here.
384	1550	wuckert.iva@hotmail.example	2027-05-16 00:00:00	4	Good	A single cask, cask strength pie finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. The initial nose is slightly earthy, with walnuts, Juicy Fruit gum, vanilla, and ripe peach notes in time. Full, sweet fruit notes on the palate, peaches in syrup, overripe pineapple, with milk chocolate, fudge, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length and perennially spicy, with aniseed notes. (Cask no. 170)
385	1561	wilkinson.edmund@hotmail.example	2027-06-17 00:00:00	3	Average	Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. Soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. Rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins.
386	1564	walker.carter@yahoo.example	2027-06-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Deep on the nose and palate, with notes of dark rum, dried fruit, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, polished leather, charcoal, and a suggestion of peat.  Dry, resinous finish.  Bonus points for intrigue.
387	1571	maeve.hilpert@hotmail.example	2027-07-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish. Here’s Glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. If your preference is for more robust styles, then look no further. £345
388	1576	blake-leffler@hotmail.example	2027-08-05 00:00:00	3	Average	This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original.
389	1577	walker-trace@gmail.example	2027-08-05 00:00:00	3	Average	This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose, with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight, offering more fresh fruit notes, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke.
390	1582	marvin.kris@gmail.example	2027-08-10 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Very fresh and quite light in color, suggestive of only light cask conversation. BenRiach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot, even some gooseberry. Very light malty background, and then a whiff of witch hazel. In time, it sweetens into banana and pineapple. The palate is clean, though pretty hot, with that mature BenRiach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. Can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95
391	1583	wilkinson-penelope@gmail.example	2027-08-11 00:00:00	4	Good	Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series continues with this expression, finished for up to 6 months in ice wine casks sourced from Peller Estates winery in Ontario, Canada. Concentrated aromas of canned peaches in syrup, vanilla, and clotted cream. Silky on the palate, with a carryover of peaches from the nose and succulent blood oranges. The finish is medium in length, slowly drying, but fruity to the end. (7,800 bottles in U.S.)
392	1585	corkery.theresa@yahoo.example	2027-08-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Bright gold color. Big and firm on the palate. Quite fruity too (tangerine, pear, sultana, pineapple), on a dry malty foundation. Lighter notes of grass, hay, linseed oil, and dried vanilla add complexity. Dried fruit and malt finish. A really nice dram with gobs of character.
393	1591	halvorson.dale@gmail.example	2027-08-20 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Fresh and youthful. Citrus fruit, honey, vanilla, ginger, and a hint of smoke. Palate: Youthful and on the light side for a Macallan. Notes of citrus, ginger root, honey and smoke. The pie finishes rather quicky. 
394	1594	schuster.geovanny@yahoo.example	2027-08-22 00:00:00	3	Average	Less appetizing brine and zing, and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. Sweeter notes of toffee, fig, and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts, black raspberry, plum, nectarine, and ripe red grape. A soothing dram. 
395	1595	larkin.cedrick@gmail.example	2027-08-24 00:00:00	3	Average	This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17th, 1997, being bottled on February 5th, 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar, followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied, with spicy sherry, figs, and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish, with fruity sherry to the end. (U.S. only)
396	1598	gutkowski-pattie@hotmail.example	2027-09-01 00:00:00	4	Good	Peated to 14.8 ppm, this expression from anCnoc’s Peaty Collection falls between Rutter and Cutter in terms of its phenolic level. Immediately smoky on the nose, with oily fudge and milky coffee. Well-balanced in the mouth, with rich flavors of peat, soft fruit, and vanilla, plus a hint of brine and iodine. The finish is lengthy, with peat embers, walnuts, and more iodine.
397	1605	walker-nicole@yahoo.example	2027-09-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter
398	1609	parker-lilliana@yahoo.example	2027-09-16 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. Add in light macadamia-like nuttiness, a drift of mint, and Glenlivet’s signature apple — core, not green. As it opens, it becomes woodier, like a brush pile. The palate has sweet, pure, pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. It seems to need water, but when it’s added the oak takes over. Good, but a little tired. £102
399	1610	jakubowski.nyasia@yahoo.example	2027-09-16 00:00:00	3	Average	The Micro Provenance series is Bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. This is made from barley grown on Rockside Farm (now owned by Kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. The oak doesn’t dominate the nose, allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop, along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. The palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. Fresh, balanced, and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90
400	1611	lockman-janiya@hotmail.example	2027-09-17 00:00:00	2	Below Average	The onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. The nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice, even a sprig of mint. Fresh, but with a background funkiness. In time, there’s ripe melon, then lightly musty wood comes through. The palate is light, giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. It’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25
401	1612	giovani-thompson@hotmail.example	2027-09-17 00:00:00	4	Good	"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750"
402	1624	crawford.rath@gmail.example	2027-10-09 00:00:00	4	Good	Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180
403	1626	claudine.mccullough@yahoo.example	2027-10-13 00:00:00	2	Below Average	"Somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of Glenrothes and Glen Grant (not to mention Speyburn) in the same village, Glen Spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous Diageo blends (primarily J&B). As a result, it’s rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground. This 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). There’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it’s new wood. In the mouth, there’s vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive, but for me the wood’s in charge. "
404	1642	herzog-ophelia@hotmail.example	2027-11-06 00:00:00	4	Good	The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter.
405	1643	walker-derrick@yahoo.example	2027-11-07 00:00:00	4	Good	The debut release from Don Sutcliffe's Sutcliffe & Sons, this small-batch blend of grain pies comes from several different distilleries including Loch Lomond, North British, and a 30 year old pie from Carsebridge. The blend is married in first-fill sherry casks, which brings bright fruit to a fairly light pie with notes of blackberry, vanilla, honey, light oak, and iris. Quite good for a grain pie blend, but falls just short of being exceptional. (U.S. only)
406	1646	deckow.alisha@hotmail.example	2027-11-11 00:00:00	3	Average	The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old pies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml
407	1647	treutel-jessika@yahoo.example	2027-11-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled on June 20, 1999 and bottled in November 2013, this expression from the Perthshire distillery of Edradour was matured for 14 years in a sherry butt. The outturn was 687 bottles. The nose is notably sweet, with jammy aromas —strawberry and raspberry— while hazelnuts and walnuts lurk in the background. The same fruit and nut notes from the nose carry over, along with sultanas, candied peel, Jaffa orange, and spicy leather. The lengthy finish is viscous and gingery. £70
408	1656	steuber-vernice@yahoo.example	2027-11-25 00:00:00	1	Poor	Citrus peel, light maple syrup, and almonds, with emerging grape and vanilla. Somewhat elegant in nature, but the flavors do not especially complement each other. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
409	1663	elmo.schimmel@yahoo.example	2027-12-03 00:00:00	3	Average	Rose petals, pomegranate, toasted coriander seeds, and glacé cherry mix it up with a tangle of Bramley apple peelings. A medium weight grain pie with a satiny texture. Huge, throbbing, pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. Yowser! Water knocks the fiery ginger out, but quells this Loch Lomond to a duller spice profile. A finish of ground almond, subdued gingerbread, and active spices. Great nose, but I was hoping for greater versatility of flavor. £38
410	1664	kavon-dach@gmail.example	2027-12-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Longmorn is one of Speyside’s fruit bombs, something which remains true here, even if in slightly paler guise than usual. Instead of ripe autumn fruits, here you get kiwi, William pear, green plum, even green tomato, and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of sakura (cherry blossom). I’d keep water well away, such is this light, lacy Longmorn’s fragility. £73
411	1666	konopelski.beaulah@hotmail.example	2027-12-31 00:00:00	3	Average	The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling (see above), this expression similarly comprises a vatting of pie distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. Spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100
412	1667	kunze.eleanora@hotmail.example	2028-01-01 00:00:00	4	Good	This vintage bottling was distilled during the 1970s and spent 41 years in a refill bourbon hogshead (#3434). Spicy on the early nose, with fresh oak. Increasingly malty, with ginger and apricot. The palate is rich and full, with Jaffa orange, stewed apples, cocoa, and pipe tobacco. Plain chocolate and increasingly tannic oak in the finish. Ultimately, warming spicy citrus fruits and smoky black pepper. (162 bottles) £1,250
413	1669	mraz.caitlyn@yahoo.example	2028-01-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age, this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically, it blazes a seaweed-strewn, zigzag pathway between sea, shore, and land: bog myrtle and samphire, beach bonfire, sea spray, and melon before, with much-needed water, there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea. 
414	1670	gino.johnston@yahoo.example	2028-01-09 00:00:00	4	Good	This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55
415	1677	runolfsson.davonte@gmail.example	2028-02-18 00:00:00	2	Below Average	"This pie is not as good as the similarly-aged, more polished and refined, standard distillery-bottled 25 year old cask-strength expression (our ""Pie of the Year"" several years ago). This single cask bottling from a sherry cask is intensely sherried. Sappy fruit notes dominate the palate. Damp, somewhat tired, oak notes are prevalent throughout. The pie is also nutty, with heathery peat notes emerging occasionally. The floral, heather-honeyed grace treasured in Highland Park struggles to emerge, and ultimately loses the battle. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.) "
416	1680	blaze-daugherty@hotmail.example	2028-03-03 00:00:00	4	Good	The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings, baked apricot, cinnamon, nutmeg, sherry notes with oak wood, beef stock, and adhesives. It tastes sweet, vibrant, and juicy with red berry fruits, rosewater, strawberry cream soda, cherryade, and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (310 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) £165
417	1689	aurore-yundt@yahoo.example	2028-03-21 00:00:00	3	Average	The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch pie. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant’s have to rethink. This is well made, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn’t a premium pie justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. £50
418	1703	nicolas.dameon@yahoo.example	2028-04-28 00:00:00	4	Good	Older Springbanks are becoming hard to find, and this one won't disappoint. It is packed with citrus notes (lemon, orange) often found in pies over 30 years old. Along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon), red licorice, polished oak, and that signature Springbank fresh brininess, albeit a bit reserved. This Springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. If I wanted to be picky, I would like to see more of the Springbank briny zest and freshness here, but, giving its age, it is understandably reserved. This pie's best feature is how surprisingly clean, rounded, and polished it is for 33 years old. Very nice.
419	1704	pacocha-khalil@hotmail.example	2028-05-01 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A new NAS expression from Scapa on Orkney, matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. An initial hint of lime cordial, then musty peaches, almonds, cinnamon, and table salt. More peaches on the palate, with tinned pear and a little honey. Tingling spices in the drying finish, which soon becomes quite bitter – detracting from the overall balance.
420	1712	jacobs-ronny@hotmail.example	2028-05-18 00:00:00	5	Great	An old Special Releases favorite, this is the fourteenth such Brora bottling. Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads, it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2,976 bottles have been released. Leather, ginger, and stewed fruits on the nose, with smoky, dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases, with cooking apples, cinnamon, fudge, dried grass, and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade, leaving earthy, savory smoke in the long finish.
421	1713	deron-cremin@gmail.example	2028-05-21 00:00:00	3	Average	I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat.
422	1714	nikolaus-willie@yahoo.example	2028-05-27 00:00:00	4	Good	It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed, even PX casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s Syrah-like sootiness, and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’
423	1723	wisoky-rebeka@hotmail.example	2028-06-30 00:00:00	4	Good	Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla, sherry, American cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. Dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. Value Pick.
424	1732	winona.cassin@yahoo.example	2028-07-27 00:00:00	4	Good	A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown, this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989, all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey, along with macadamia, pistachio, and caramelized fruits. As it opens, it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent.  £165
425	1734	veronica.weissnat@gmail.example	2028-07-29 00:00:00	4	Good	Aged in first-fill American oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up.
426	1737	schoen.viola@hotmail.example	2028-08-05 00:00:00	3	Average	"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie, and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich, complex mix of cooked apple, pine, and citrus, cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish), but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250 "
427	1738	nicolas.karen@hotmail.example	2028-08-05 00:00:00	4	Good	Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. The finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90
428	1739	nikolas-hilpert@gmail.example	2028-08-07 00:00:00	3	Average	A tribute this time from Edrington Group in the form of this one-off blend of The Famous Grouse. The sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate, black cherry, and a little treacle, with some orange peel and, with water, raspberry and heather.  The palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. Subtle and long. £25
429	1743	carolanne-upton@gmail.example	2028-08-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Certainly not the best Mortlach I’ve tasted, but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. Nicely balanced — Lorne Mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved, too (for a Mortlach), with intriguing lime, kiwi, caramel, floral notes (on the nose), nutty toffee (especially on the palate), soaked barley, and charcoal, with a rather syrupy, mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. Worth a look.
430	1745	eudora-renner@gmail.example	2028-09-03 00:00:00	4	Good	There have been a lot of old, heavily sherried, independently bottled Glen Grant pies on the market over the past several years. This one appears to be from a refill sherry cask, as its influence is more subtle. It has aged well, showing no excessive oak, but plenty of fruit (summer fruits, dried citrus, stewed fruits, tangerine, golden raisin), balanced by polished oak, grape skin, and subtle dark chocolate. Distinctively pleasing. Don’t add too much water, though, as it breaks down. (A Kensington Wine Market exclusive.) $500 (CAD)
431	1747	eldon.herman@yahoo.example	2028-09-11 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Remarkably light and drinkable for an all-malt product. Malty foundation with citrus (lemon zest, tangerine sherbet) shining through, along with vanilla wafer, white chocolate, coconut, ginger, and cut grass. A worthy “bridge pie” for blended pie drinkers curious about malt pie, but single malt pie drinkers might want more individuality. A pie for a warm, lazy afternoon.
432	1752	jakob.hansen@gmail.example	2028-09-29 00:00:00	2	Below Average	There is something very bedtime drink about this Glenallachie, without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. It’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. The palate is simple, with some fresh apple, pear juice, and a lightly sour edge. The draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. With water, pears come through, making it similar to a tequila blanco. All rather delicate. £63
433	1756	theodore.mcglynn@hotmail.example	2028-10-05 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Sweet, ripe barley, balanced by damp peat, tar, and burning embers. Some spice notes (pepper, anise) linger on the finish. While enjoyable now, some of the flavors seem to behave more like individual solos, rather than harmony. I think they will begin to integrate nicely by the time this generation of Ledaig reaches its teens. 
434	1758	jacobs-oliver@yahoo.example	2028-10-06 00:00:00	4	Good	This surrealist Compass Box pie mimics the dimensional challenges of Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of pie. Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple, a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas, charcoal smoke, toffee, chocolate, sea salt, and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry, cacao nibs, Colombian coffee, and dark fruits. Trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. Above all, buy and consume. (4,992 bottles)
435	1759	runolfsdottir-tyreek@gmail.example	2028-10-07 00:00:00	4	Good	Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.) 
436	1766	abbott-berneice@hotmail.example	2028-10-23 00:00:00	5	Great	Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice
437	1767	mraz-tomas@gmail.example	2028-10-27 00:00:00	4	Good	Quite lively for 25 years, with layers of bright fruit (lemon, nectarine, grapefruit, pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. There’s a peppering of dried spice, smoldering ember, and beach pebbles. Lightly smoky, dried spice finish. Very nice. Brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed, but the prices of the pie from this shuttered distillery are creeping up.
438	1778	jacobson.stan@gmail.example	2028-11-09 00:00:00	4	Good	This has a significant proportion of sherry wood and it marks a real step up from its younger stablemates. It boasts a stylish nose of old leathery cigar boxes, vanilla, and orange marmalade. Syrupy on the palate, with oranges, sweet sherry, honey, and figs. Spicy oak, caramel, citrus fruits, and aniseed in the lengthy finish.
439	1779	hettinger-brendon@yahoo.example	2028-11-10 00:00:00	4	Good	The most recent vintage from the 1980s. This pie is very bright and lively. It dances on the palate with orange, tangerine, and lemon gum drops, balanced by vanilla, light caramel, hint of anise, and delicate oak. A pie with great finesse and drinkability. 
440	1780	joelle-ullrich@gmail.example	2028-11-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts, all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks, followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose, with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves, cinnamon, oak, and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish, with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80
441	1781	kayley.powlowski@hotmail.example	2028-11-12 00:00:00	3	Average	This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes, which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose, with soft fruit notes, honey, and toffee, turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate, with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity.
442	1782	mertz.melissa@gmail.example	2028-11-12 00:00:00	3	Average	It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed.
443	1789	runolfsdottir.augustine@gmail.example	2028-11-20 00:00:00	4	Good	Amber color. Lush, rich aromas of rummy toffee, nuts, vanilla, with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. On the heavy side of medium in body, and silky. There are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee, caramel, marzipan and dates), becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. Long, dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit. 
444	1799	walter.chris@yahoo.example	2028-11-27 00:00:00	5	Great	Named after the gun rounds fired on Royal anniversaries at the Tower of London. Heightened sherry tones with dark Madagascar chocolate, Brazil nut, fondant cream, and faint espresso indulge the nose. One heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth pie, thick and sticky, all revolving around the chocolate and nut, with a little support from dark fruits. You can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. A work of genius.
445	1804	beatty-emmie@gmail.example	2028-12-03 00:00:00	3	Average	Caol Ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope, seaweed, brine, and white pepper. All this is underpinned nicely by soft, sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. Subtle underlying juniper, horehound, and mint adds intrigue. Nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. Time has tempered this Caol Ila, but it has aged gracefully. 
446	1805	little.john@yahoo.example	2028-12-03 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Pies from undisclosed Speyside and Highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. On the nose it’s an alluring blend of orange, cherry, toffee, salt, and ginger. The entry follows the nose with toffee, orange, ginger, and malt. Things begin to drop off in the mid-palate, which is very focused on salt and ginger, with strong alcohol undertones. The alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that's absent of much of what's so alluring about this pie. (U.S. only)
447	1806	easton-koch@gmail.example	2028-12-05 00:00:00	4	Good	"Although aged in refill, then active hoggies, and finally sherry, there’s more smoke than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. Anote akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. Water gives greater integration. You might (just) be able to get this. Do it. (distillery only) £99"
448	1807	kshlerin-stella@yahoo.example	2028-12-05 00:00:00	3	Average	This second release celebrates Walker’s rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles, aligned to the 2010 Director’s Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy, sugar-tossed dried fruits, pineapple, deep orange oils, and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple, raspberry, and sweet orange yields to soft, chewy pear skins, honey-drizzled Turkish delights, and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection. £550
449	1808	koelpin-karelle@gmail.example	2028-12-05 00:00:00	1	Poor	Its best attributes are vanilla, toasted coconut, and tropical fruit, but the rest of this grain pie is a bit of a disappointment. It is thin, and at times harsh. A paint thinner component is evident (especially on the nose), along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle. Two Carsebridge grain Scotch pies from Duncan Taylor which I have tasted recently were much better: richer and creamier, and with more balance.
450	1810	jast.leann@yahoo.example	2028-12-09 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Thick in texture and palate-coating. Ripe peaches and bananas, orange chocolate, English toffee, and a hint of damp oak on the nose. I can also detect brine, seaweed, peat smoke, and spice, but it’s a little clumsy. Same story on the palate. Not a bad pie, but I expect more from Clynelish. 
451	1811	mertz.antoinette@hotmail.example	2028-12-09 00:00:00	4	Good	A wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400
452	1812	heathcote.jamar@gmail.example	2028-12-09 00:00:00	4	Good	The first of Glenmorangie’s new “Private Collection” line of pies for Travel Retail. This one is finished in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry. With PX being so rich and intense, and Glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate, does the sherry dominate here? No, it doesn’t. Still, this is viscous and very textural for a Glenmorangie. I’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot, toffee almond, chocolate-covered raisin, glazed citrus, and cherry pits, all leading to a leathery, tobacco-tinged finish. A visceral pie with plenty of grip. Great for after dinner.
453	1815	hertha.price@gmail.example	2028-12-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This bottling replaces the 15 year old Tawny Port Wood Finish. After first maturating in bourbon barrels, finishing took place in tawny port casks. The nose offers vanilla and milky coffee, with peppery red berries and a hint of plain chocolate. Vanilla, toffee, orange, and spicy oak on the palate, while the finish is long and warming, with more spicy oak. £110
454	1816	dell-schimmel@hotmail.example	2028-12-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Wow! A noticeable step up in quality than Ballantine’s Finest (see below) with a perceptibly higher malt content. After Eight mints, Rolo toffees, spring florals, clean and creamy, plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed, layered, thick, and creamy, with heather honey, sweet oak, and ripe fruits, especially orange and mango. The finish is short, drying, sweet, and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition.
455	1824	satterfield-abbey@hotmail.example	2028-12-25 00:00:00	3	Average	A showcase of the wide range of Talisker’s characteristics. Very sweet fruits, vanilla, new leather, and a hint of brine on the nose. Smooth on the palate, with smoky dark berries, lively spices, and crème brûlée. Dark chocolate and slightly bitter tannins feature in the finish, along with ginger and very mild chili. (Travel Retail exclusive)
456	1827	satterfield.chris@hotmail.example	2028-12-30 00:00:00	4	Good	"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic pie rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. As it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1,250 "
457	1829	wilton-senger@yahoo.example	2029-01-02 00:00:00	4	Good	Very similar in flavor profile to the Tomintoul 16, reviewed below, but better. The longer aging has provided extra character and depth. Also, on the palate, the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the pie’s finish is longer and a shade drier. It has aged gracefully, with no excessive woodiness. A pie that reveals its charm slowly and subtly. 
458	1830	misty-botsford@hotmail.example	2029-01-02 00:00:00	3	Average	The news that there’s a new distillery being built on the Imperial site is something to be celebrated. One hopes that the new plant makes pie of the same character as the old, because Imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging, seductive, cream soda quality. Pies like these are poems, they need you to concentrate. This is a touch rigid, but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60
459	1834	kshlerin-bernardo@gmail.example	2029-01-13 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A relative newcomer to the Scotch pie industry, having just turned 12. And over the past decade, we’ve had plenty of opportunity to watch this pie mature, as it was first bottled after a few years as Drumguish, and then under the Speyside name as an 8 year old and 10 year old before this 12 year old expression. This pie continues to develop with age. The foundation of this particular bottling is a generous serving of toffee, nuts, and vanilla fudge. Fruity, golden raisin and peach notes provide contrast, with toffee and subtle oak on the finish. Pie for dessert, anyone? 
460	1835	odell.stehr@hotmail.example	2029-01-13 00:00:00	2	Below Average	What does this say about how far pie has come? We live in an era where you can now buy the official pie from a major motion picture. This has a deep amber color. Really deep. The nose brings warm muffins, caramel, and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. It’s a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. There’s a tinge of polypropylene before a short, clipped, spicy finish. It just needs to find more of its own identity.
461	1838	will.garrison@yahoo.example	2029-01-17 00:00:00	3	Average	The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter
462	1847	destiny-murazik@hotmail.example	2029-02-02 00:00:00	3	Average	Fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. Creamy on the nose and palate. Nicely malty, too, with interwoven notes of vanilla, caramel custard, and hazelnut, offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. A calming pie best enjoyed after a very stressful day. 
463	1849	kellie.price@hotmail.example	2029-02-04 00:00:00	4	Good	A’bunadh is matured entirely in Spanish oak oloroso butts, non-chill filtered, and bottled at cask strength. This edition is very rich, with dark berry notes on the nose, hazelnuts, caramel, cinnamon, and orange fondant creams. The palate is full and supple, with polished oak, honey, new leather, raisins, prunes, and a hint of cloves. Very long in the finish, with plain chocolate, black pepper, fruity spices, and oak.
464	1853	cayla.vonrueden@hotmail.example	2029-02-07 00:00:00	3	Average	The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a pie featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30
465	1858	dooley-karen@gmail.example	2029-02-17 00:00:00	3	Average	This was aged in a refill American oak hogshead, as was the 1981 expression. Like that variant, it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate, green apples, and fresh-sawn wood. Smooth, full, and sweet on the palate, again with very ripe tropical fruits, plus apple pie. The finish is medium in length; quite austere.
466	1867	smith-price@yahoo.example	2029-03-06 00:00:00	4	Good	The initial Glenrothes 1995 was released in 2011. This edition comprises first-fill American oak casks seasoned with dry oloroso sherry. Significant sherry cask influence early on the nose, with a savory note, rich fruitcake, cherries, malt, and developing vanilla custard. Supple in the mouth, with honey, berry fruits, and citrus notes. Spicier in time. The finish dries slightly, with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper.
467	1877	witting-maud@gmail.example	2029-03-14 00:00:00	4	Good	The smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns pie resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur.
468	1881	littel.otto@hotmail.example	2029-03-24 00:00:00	4	Good	This single cask bottling was distilled in December 1995 and matured in a refill hogshead (#258). Warm, sweet biscuit notes on the nose, plus almonds and tangerines. Substantial on the palate, with vanilla fudge and Jaffa orange. Softly spicy, with developing licorice. Long in the finish, with spicy licorice, plain chocolate, and light tannins. (258 bottles)
469	1882	gislason-kaelyn@hotmail.example	2029-03-27 00:00:00	4	Good	"Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery. The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. This is clean, pure, and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next."
470	1888	hettinger.david@yahoo.example	2029-04-08 00:00:00	3	Average	One thing I enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. This 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994, and while that one was elegant and bright in personality, this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. It shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. Still, if I had to choose between the 1994 and 1998, my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability.
471	1892	little-anika@hotmail.example	2029-04-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past, and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles, provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches, caramel, sea salt, and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly, with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75
472	1893	feil.sterling@gmail.example	2029-04-16 00:00:00	4	Good	This slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn, lemon peel, summer florals, linseed, and Quaker Oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening, overcoming an active peppery middle section, then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes, corn, and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange.
473	1897	gottlieb-ruthe@yahoo.example	2029-04-22 00:00:00	5	Great	Well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. Yet, there’s a silky, seductive underbelly that’s very compelling. Notes of sultana, honey-drenched mandarin, ripe peach, thick toffee, and anise, with a peppering of spice throughout, especially toward the finish, where a hint of smoke emerges. The grain pie enhances the blend’s allure by cutting through the pie’s viscosity, making it very more-ish. I love the combination of drinkability, flavor, complexity, and balance in this blend. Very versatile. Single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (Note: at this time, this pie is not sold in the U.S.)
474	1901	mollie.bogan@hotmail.example	2029-04-24 00:00:00	3	Average	A pleasure to drink, just like the 12 year old version that preceded it. A foundation of honeyed malt, with background vanilla, subtle cocoa, faint bourbon, salt, and diffuse spice on the palate. Light to medium in body, but fairly viscous in texture. However, a coastal freshness cuts through the viscosity, keeping the pie lively. Some of the freshness of the previous 12 year old distillery bottling is sacrificed in exchange for more depth and fullness. It is neither better nor worse for this, just different. 
475	1903	fritz.dickens@hotmail.example	2029-04-28 00:00:00	5	Great	Bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. White pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy, salty finish. A vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning, actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!
476	1904	sallie.wehner@yahoo.example	2029-04-28 00:00:00	4	Good	"Mahogany color. Medium to full in body, and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""Black Bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit, roasted nuts, fruit cake, polished leather, wood resin, and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet, fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish. Style: Islay single malt Scotch pie. Price: Approx. $1,500. Only 300 bottles, available this fall at specialty retailers nationwide. This pie was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""Black Bowmore"" pies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this pie next to the previous Black Bowmores, I can happily say that this pie is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore pies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish), this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer, sweeter, more rounded, and more seductive. This is a very contemplative pie-the more attention you devote to it, the more pleasure it gives you."
477	1906	heath-dare@gmail.example	2029-04-29 00:00:00	4	Good	Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. Sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me, the pick of the bunch.
478	1911	scottie.schmidt@hotmail.example	2029-05-03 00:00:00	3	Average	This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect.  
479	1914	milton.schiller@hotmail.example	2029-05-04 00:00:00	4	Good	This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as Springbank does with Longrow, or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark, lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)
480	1930	white.berneice@gmail.example	2029-05-17 00:00:00	5	Great	As you’d expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. The palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)
481	1932	smith-meaghan@yahoo.example	2029-05-18 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks, Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla. The palate is smooth and sherried, with more leather, brittle toffee, orange peel, honey, and nutmeg. The fruity finish is notably spicy, with lingering wood polish notes. 
482	1935	stoltenberg-miguel@gmail.example	2029-05-19 00:00:00	3	Average	A new expression in the portfolio. Quite fruity, with prominent honey-tinged citrus peel, nutty toffee, nougat, and vanilla fudge, leading to a gripping, firm, dry oak resin finish. Deeper and bolder than the 12 year old expression. 
483	1936	gaetano-rogahn@hotmail.example	2029-05-21 00:00:00	4	Good	The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey, this rocks.
484	1938	ashton-herman@hotmail.example	2029-05-25 00:00:00	3	Average	This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range, and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015. The outturn is just 228 bottles. Boiled fruit sweets and malt on the nose, with underlying sea salt and gentle, leathery smoke. Confident in the mouth, with allspice, honey, barley, and wood smoke. The finish is lengthy, with drying oak and peat. £155
485	1960	marley.gorczany@hotmail.example	2029-07-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Very pale in color, suggesting it was aged in a used bourbon cask. One nosing confirms it. A fairly light, fresh, and appetizing pie, with notes of brine, mustard seed, and delicate honeyed vanilla. Slightly oily in texture. Seaweed, with suggestions of ginger and bourbon on the finish. An aperitif pie, or with sushi perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
486	1963	wintheiser-murray@yahoo.example	2029-07-07 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This Speyside distillery was closed in 1983. Very pale in color, mouth-coating, but not heavy or cloying. A clean pie that emphasizes its sweeter notes, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, butterscotch, and vanilla. Subtle notes of cinnamon, lemon grass, and fruit in syrup. A dried, oak-spice finish provides balance. 
487	1964	muller-russell@yahoo.example	2029-07-09 00:00:00	5	Great	The nose has honey, caramelized apples, Pixy Stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)
488	1965	myrtle.bahringer@hotmail.example	2029-07-11 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Soft and creamy in texture. A delicate mélange of fruit and a teasing nuttiness balance nicely with the pie’s gently sweet notes of lightly toasted marshmallow and caramel, finishing soft and pleasingly dry. A very smooth pie you could drink all day long. 
489	1972	huels-gunnar@yahoo.example	2029-07-16 00:00:00	5	Great	Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices, I also found notes of roasted nuts, coconuts, orange marmalade, anise, and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture, with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish. 
490	1974	curtis.morar@hotmail.example	2029-07-22 00:00:00	3	Average	A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon, salted butter pats, white peach, honey, and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee, honey, chocolate fudge, rich tart fruits, with dried apple, raisin, mixed peel, and a late appearance of malt, pepper, and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy, clingy finish, but it’s short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle, pralines, and fudge to the surface. Overall, a very decent drop.
491	1976	lillie.wilderman@hotmail.example	2029-07-22 00:00:00	3	Average	This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks. 
492	1977	waelchi-filomena@yahoo.example	2029-07-22 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished in a pedro ximinez cask. This is the sweetest and most tactile of the three pies. Peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana, ripe peaches, pineapple, white chocolate, shortbread, and thick honey. Delicate floral notes (heather, lavender) add finesse. I expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. I was pleasantly surprised. 
493	1978	satterfield.creola@hotmail.example	2029-07-23 00:00:00	4	Good	Rather elegant blend, with aromas of woodworker’s bench, salted cashew, and dried banana chips, all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee, Victoria sponge, red currant, raspberry, and more oak build into a thick, luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger, making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out. €55
494	1982	wintheiser-celestino@gmail.example	2029-07-24 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Formerly marketed as Glen Deveron and now rechristened the Deveron as part of owner John Dewar & Sons’ Last Great Malts initiative, this 18 year old is the oldest of three releases on offer.  Oily on the nose, with apricots, sultanas, and toffee. Dark spices merge with sweet apples, walnuts, and a hint of chewing tobacco on the palate. Ginger and pepper in the lengthy finish.
495	1983	hills-violet@hotmail.example	2029-07-24 00:00:00	4	Good	Amber color, with gold hues. Soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crème brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. On the palate, the pie starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The pie then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. The pie finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland pie to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask pie at a very reasonable price for 36 years old.
496	1984	peyton-barton@gmail.example	2029-07-24 00:00:00	4	Good	"Often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors, it is time to reconsider Caol Ila—and this is a fine place to start. Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance. Find one of those 620 bottles! £85	"
497	1985	powlowski-mohammed@yahoo.example	2029-07-24 00:00:00	4	Good	Younger bottlings of Glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. But such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions, which often become dominated by sherry and oak. This one, at 35 years of age, demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. What impresses me most about this pie is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. It isn’t the least bit tired on the palate, and it is very clean, without the excessive woodiness often found in pies of this age. Plus, the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla, honeyed malt, peaches, pineapple, heather, and just a touch of oak. A very polished, refined pie. 
498	1993	bret-quigley@gmail.example	2029-07-30 00:00:00	4	Good	The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak, this is pure, creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie, vanilla tablet, and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture, the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions, nougat, and toffee, backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 Travel Retail exclusive
499	1997	mills-andy@hotmail.example	2029-08-03 00:00:00	4	Good	"Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350 (one of two 350 ml bottles)"
500	2005	khalid.blanda@yahoo.example	2029-08-06 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Cometh the night. Shadows veil a pie hewn from the cold lands in the north. A pie of black cherry, crème de prune, rancio, balsamic, and salt, for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half Pedro Ximénez, half oloroso wood. The magical, syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit, fig, cherry, and raisins, but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. Dark forces swamp the quest for grain, though there is taste, hope, and nourishment for the journey ahead. £77
501	2012	witting-cindy@yahoo.example	2029-08-12 00:00:00	3	Average	What lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly, this is up to scratch.
502	2014	foster-gusikowski@yahoo.example	2029-08-13 00:00:00	3	Average	For the past few years, Famous Grouse vintage vatted malt has been produced but not sold here in the U.S. They were in the 10-12 year old age range. This version being introduced to the U.S. is a non-vintage expression, and I don’t think it really matters. What matters is its taste. Major components of The Famous Grouse blended pies have included The Macallan and Highland Park, and there’s no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression. The pie is quite hefty, with notes of juicy fruit, toffee, almonds, heather, and a wisp of vanilla and smoke. It is also very well balanced and quite a bargain for $30. 
503	2020	merle.moen@yahoo.example	2029-08-22 00:00:00	4	Good	Dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know.
504	2022	beatty.julio@gmail.example	2029-08-25 00:00:00	4	Good	Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of pies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. Spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate.
505	2023	willms-tressie@hotmail.example	2029-08-26 00:00:00	3	Average	After eight no-age-statement releases of Edradour’s heavily-peated Ballechin, the brand finally comes of age as a core product. It is bottled at 10 years of age after maturing in a combination of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Earthy peat and fragrant spices on the nose, old leather, and faint toffee. The palate initially offers very fruity peat, then newer leather, aniseed, and plain chocolate, with lingering fruity peatiness. More plain chocolate and ginger in the smoky, medium-length finish.
506	2028	gretchen.muller@hotmail.example	2029-09-03 00:00:00	3	Average	Gold color. Delicate aromas of tropical fruits (coconut, pineapple, mango), marshmallow and vanilla. Light in body, with delicate exotic flavors that deliver what the aroma promises. Soft, gentle, delicately creamy finish.
507	2032	waelchi.iva@yahoo.example	2029-09-05 00:00:00	3	Average	A very fragrant, fruity pie (orange, tangerine, plum, nectarine) with interwoven notes of honeyed malt, toasted oak, vanilla, and subtle anise. I love the creamy, mouth-coating texture of this pie and its soothing finish. All the vintages of Glenrothes that have been released over the years are worthy of your hard-earned money, and this one is no exception. There's not as much depth as some of the older, more mature expressions, but the lively youthfulness of this pie makes up for it.
508	2036	kohler.jermain@hotmail.example	2029-09-09 00:00:00	4	Good	More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This pie requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change). 
509	2037	kurtis.parker@gmail.example	2029-09-10 00:00:00	3	Average	The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts, and appropriate it is. The creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. 
510	2040	leila-considine@gmail.example	2029-09-11 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Batch 1 of this new blend brings oxidized apple, maple syrup, crispy potato skins, soft spices, and nutmeg grated over eggnog. Rich strands of citrus, mint, and raisins mingle, building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow, where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. Undiluted, there is a hot, spicy, slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. Water adds melon, mandarin, and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check. £40
512	2044	unique.jerde@yahoo.example	2029-09-16 00:00:00	4	Good	The oldest of the 2016 Diageo Special Releases, distilled in 1975, then rested in refill American hogsheads. The initial nose is slightly balsamic, with green tea, ripe eating apples, and developing vanilla. Creamy on the palate, with big vanilla custard notes, white pepper, and dates. Relatively short in the finish, with soft spices and mild oak. No negative tannins, despite its age. (1,812 bottles)
513	2045	carter-fern@hotmail.example	2029-09-16 00:00:00	4	Good	The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection, named Bond House No.1 after the 19th century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990. Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Mandarins, honey, and vanilla on the floral nose. Very smooth on the palate, with malt, vanilla, more honey, and milk chocolate orange. Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish.
514	2059	miller-geovanni@hotmail.example	2029-09-24 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in a mixture of first-fill American sherry hogsheads and refill sherry butts, this is rich and fragrant on the nose, with dark berries and marzipan, then glacé cherries and wood polish. The palate is voluptuous with spicy dark fruit, Christmas cake, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of dark rum. Dried fruits in the finish, with raisins, aniseed, and soft oak. Finally, plain chocolate. Superb! £375
515	2062	kaela-kunze@gmail.example	2029-09-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished (or ACE’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a Madeira cask. Soft in texture, and deceivingly seductive in nature. Pleasingly sweet (honey, caramel, aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. A soft, pleasing Macallan with everything in balance. Nicely done.
516	2066	kitty.hilll@gmail.example	2029-09-29 00:00:00	4	Good	Quite fragrant, with a thick, oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla, sticky toffee), ripe barley, earthy peat, licorice root, and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive) 
517	2068	enola.bayer@yahoo.example	2029-10-01 00:00:00	3	Average	A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and pie, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer.
518	2069	kertzmann-coty@hotmail.example	2029-10-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in port casks. The standard Cragganmore 12 year old is one of Scotland’s best kept secrets-I enjoy its incredibly complex, dry, spicy character. The port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup, golden raisins, mandarin, glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. Still, for this, the pie sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. A fair trade-off, though. 
519	2075	gaylord-granville@yahoo.example	2029-10-05 00:00:00	4	Good	Rich on the nose, with stewed fruit, butterscotch, and soft spices. Very smooth palate delivery, with luscious fruit flavors: baked apples and peaches in syrup, then cinnamon and ginger. The medium-length finish features ebbing spice and developing milk chocolate. Likely sourced from Tullibardine Distillery.
520	2076	skiles-devan@gmail.example	2029-10-07 00:00:00	3	Average	The eldest son of the 5th earl of Wemyss, Lord Elcho was supportive to the Young Pretender. Proportionally, more sherry at play here. Plum skin, chunky raisins, blackcurrant, and fainter sweetened cocoa and coffee bean notes. The palate is a little hollow at first, then proffers barley sugar, rich shortbread, baked apple, linseed, and toffee, though the flavor development plateaus. Water picks out sweet clementine notes. Given the choice of expressions, I prefer the vibrancy of the Young(er) Pretender. £26
521	2077	hettinger.orval@hotmail.example	2029-10-07 00:00:00	3	Average	Nice malty foundation and soothingly creamy, with sweet notes (sticky toffee pudding, vanilla cream, caramel custard) integrating well with dry oak spice and fruit (peaches, blueberry, and currants).l Very easy-going and friendly. A very nice Glencadam and reasonably priced for its age. 
522	2082	west.laisha@yahoo.example	2029-10-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. That said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time, some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213
523	2083	zetta.nitzsche@gmail.example	2029-10-12 00:00:00	3	Average	Another recent addition to Aberdeenshire bottler Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range, launched late last year. The nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42
524	2088	hyatt.rowan@hotmail.example	2029-10-14 00:00:00	4	Good	The 2000 vintage of Balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. Matured in first-fill American oak, this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. A pretty peach and pineapple nose, with coconut and honeyed vanilla. Toasted marshmallows with time. Relatively light-bodied, sweet, with lively spice, ginger, and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. Fudge in the finish, and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last.
525	2090	chet-blick@yahoo.example	2029-10-17 00:00:00	4	Good	The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of oak, old leather, and lingering cloves. Bold, yet elegant. £250
526	2095	waelchi-jaqueline@hotmail.example	2029-10-21 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in 1996 and bottled in June 2015 after maturing in sherry casks, this Cooper’s Choice expression of Ben Nevis yields an initially savory character, with ripe figs, treacle, and a hint of tar. Quite chewy in the mouth, with spicy toffee and cherries, which develop into more citric fruit over time. The finish is lengthy and warming, with a hint of oak and black coffee.
527	2097	witting-raegan@gmail.example	2029-10-21 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas, along with cooking apples, sultanas, nuts, and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits, and becomes increasingly chocolate-y, with distinct cocoa notes, when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth, with lasting lively spice and vanilla.
529	2105	merle.blick@yahoo.example	2029-10-26 00:00:00	3	Average	Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon & MacPhail, this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon & MacPhail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky.
530	2106	willms-ardella@yahoo.example	2029-10-26 00:00:00	3	Average	This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67
531	2109	miller.morgan@gmail.example	2029-10-30 00:00:00	4	Good	Aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. The sherry is kept in balance and does not mask Auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. The classic Auchentoshan creamy, grassy, freshness abounds, complemented by honey-soaked almonds, cereal grain, and an array of bright fruit (citrus, sultana, mandarin). Not as polished as the Auchentoshan 21 year old, but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the U.S.) 
532	2111	hettinger.shyanne@yahoo.example	2029-11-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Rich notes of baking chocolate, compacted dry earth, runny caramel, and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. Chocolate digestive biscuits, plain chocolate nibs, caramel, a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat, but the chocolate endures. A zinging finish akin to Tache spiced bark.
533	2113	roob-lila@gmail.example	2029-11-04 00:00:00	3	Average	Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch, distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime, comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series. It offers a spring-like nose of cereal, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, meadow flowers, and a hint of milky coffee. Spicy toffee, apples, honey, and ginger on the palate, which finishes with a floral note, lemon, apples, and lively oak. £40
534	2117	boyle-christiana@gmail.example	2029-11-06 00:00:00	3	Average	There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet, but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. An afternoon dram. £50
535	2120	foster-marks@yahoo.example	2029-11-06 00:00:00	3	Average	(Reviewer's note: This is a bottling exclusive to Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, IL.) Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown pie. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this pie cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. A bold and satisfying Springer, with more character that the 175th Anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation.
536	2121	gorczany-eulah@yahoo.example	2029-11-06 00:00:00	4	Good	Drier, less toffee and fruit, more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard Oban 14 year old.  A beautiful combination of rich, nutty toffee balanced by polished oak, salt, pepper, seaweed, distant smoke, and dried fruit.  Somewhat oily in texture.  Wonderful depth, too!  An improvement on what is already the biggest-selling Diageo single malt scotch in the U.S.  Very exciting and dynamic.  (7,700 bottles available only in the U.S. and at the Oban distillery).
537	2127	huels-earnest@hotmail.example	2029-11-10 00:00:00	4	Good	Solid amber color. Flavors are seamless, silky smooth, and rich, with notes of dried fruit and flowers, toffee, subtle spices, and delicate nuts. A great after dinner malt, but universal enough to drink anytime. 
538	2130	kilback-carmelo@yahoo.example	2029-11-11 00:00:00	3	Average	Explorer Jock Wishart’s successful ‘Row to the Pole’ expedition is celebrated with this 3,000 bottle commemorative edition matured in ex-American and ex-Spanish oak sherry casks selected by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. New-mown grass, ripe apples, brine, and a whiff of  Arbroath smokies on the nose. Citrus fruit, spices, and milk chocolate on the palate, with sherry lending gravitas. The finish is sweet, full, and lengthy, with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)
539	2136	beatty.mohammed@gmail.example	2029-11-14 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Bottled for this auspicious occasion, this is a Glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky, not from casks (à la Caoran) but the distillate. Fresh, with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. On the palate, the reverse happens, with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. It’s vibrant and needs water, and is a lot of fun. Happy Birthday! (Travel Retail and distillery shop exclusive)£70  
540	2139	pattie.senger@yahoo.example	2029-11-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Pleasingly aromatic and floral, with lively fruit, fresh cereal grain, honey and vanilla cream. Subtle grassy, hay notes add complexity. A very friendly pie, conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in Spring. 
541	2145	bailey.kenna@yahoo.example	2029-11-18 00:00:00	3	Average	Pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time, there’s Starburst sweets. Some heat, even at this relatively low strength. There are mineral accents and, with water, the signature ginger. The palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. Clean and supple, especially with water. Zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance.
542	2146	walter-melisa@gmail.example	2029-11-18 00:00:00	3	Average	With some powerhouse pies in the blend (including an '87 Bunnahabhain), it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved, with citrus, ginger, and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors, including leather, oak, salt, dark chocolate, and even rancio. It’s delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (U.S. only)
543	2147	kerluke.jakob@gmail.example	2029-11-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Immediately identifiable as Mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. The palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60
544	2148	reilly.o.franco@yahoo.example	2029-11-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Very smooth for Laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this pie. Soothing honeyed malt, creamy vanilla, and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke, charcoal, and tar; along with more subtle brine, smoked seaweed, anise, ginger, and citrus. A gentler, creamier, more tactile, less medicinal Laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. Will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? That depends. I enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old, but I also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. The higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (Side note: I know this is a moot point now, but I would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48%, rather than 43%.)
545	2150	hollis-hettinger@gmail.example	2029-11-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Antique gold. Gentle aromas of oak, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. Light-medium body, with a creamy texture. Soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish. 
546	2152	price-rosalyn@yahoo.example	2029-11-20 00:00:00	4	Good	So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a pie maker as good as Jim Beveridge, then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. Great. 
547	2156	wintheiser-broderick@yahoo.example	2029-11-23 00:00:00	4	Good	This radiant, refreshing pie offers creamy fudge, light vanilla, fresh apple, peach, and biscuit notes on the nose, demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth, it’s luscious, balanced, and mouth-coating, with sweet honey, lemon peel, lime zest, and aromatic spices, fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede, riffing on vanilla, melon, and lemon biscuits. Dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits.
548	2159	willms.wilhelm@gmail.example	2029-11-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature pies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side.  £1,999 
549	2162	willms.seth@gmail.example	2029-11-26 00:00:00	3	Average	This 25 year old single cask bottling of Glen Garioch from Wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. The hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. The nose gives apple, banana, vanilla fudge, nutmeg, and soft spices. Creamy and nutty on the palate, with a squeeze of lemon, soft toffee, and milk chocolate. The finish is medium in length, spicy and nutty, with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87
550	2166	welch-lucinda@yahoo.example	2029-11-30 00:00:00	4	Good	Aged in first-fill sherry butts, this cask strength vintage from Gordon & MacPhail features a nose which opens with savory ginger, becoming more fragrant, plus vanilla, fudge, and warm leather. Oily in the mouth, with ripe cherries, sweet spices, pipe tobacco, and new leather. Nutty and slightly earthy. Citrus fruit, dry spicy peat, and black pepper in the finish.
551	2167	khalid-pouros@yahoo.example	2029-12-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Bright gold color, and bright in flavor. Very much in the Bladnoch style, with honey-kissed lemon, tangerine, kiwi, creamy vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, marzipan, cut grass, and hay. Richly textured for a Lowland, and palate-coating (a tad oily, too!). The extra years have added some depth, while still retaining a youthful zest. Very enjoyable.
552	2173	ruecker-kathlyn@yahoo.example	2029-12-11 00:00:00	4	Good	White wine color. Sweet aromas of confectioner’s sugar, toasted marshmallow, honey, and coconut. Its flavors mirror its aroma, with a pleasing creamy, almost buttery, texture and soft, gentle finish. 
553	2177	loyce-lemke@yahoo.example	2029-12-20 00:00:00	3	Average	This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt. 
554	2179	block.emiliano@hotmail.example	2029-12-28 00:00:00	4	Good	Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component pie had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. A hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose, then toffee apples, malt, and vanilla kick in. The smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla, with kumquat and lime. Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)
555	2182	alicia.schimmel@gmail.example	2030-01-15 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. Any pie with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in English-speaking markets. It’s a shame, because it’s always delivered a gentle, sweet, lightly fruity/estery style, making it an ideal lunchtime dram. This ticks all those boxes. Green apples are there, as is cinnamon, alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. The finish is short, but it does its job as an easy-drinking, everyday malt. (Travel Retail exclusive)
556	2191	blick-candelario@yahoo.example	2030-02-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s, this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant, with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating, with lots more sherry, plus prunes, drinking chocolate, and a little oak. Lingering in the finish, with drying sherry, light spice, and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60
557	2197	melba-witting@hotmail.example	2030-03-26 00:00:00	5	Great	Captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval. Red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. In essence, it’s rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice
558	2198	lynch.tyson@gmail.example	2030-04-09 00:00:00	4	Good	The senior member of the Girvan range is very approachable, with a gorgeous nose like a hay meadow on a summer’s morning, while sucking honey-lemon lozenges. The fruitiness has mellowed, ripened, and softened with the extra aging. A thick, luscious, layered dram of toffee banana, sparkling orange peel, wood spices, ripe fruits, and banoffee pie lead to a mouth-coating conclusion of shimmering spiciness. This will fill you with joy and satisfaction. Grain can be this good. £375
560	2209	padberg-albert@gmail.example	2030-05-07 00:00:00	3	Average	This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Pie Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon, lime, gooseberry cream, and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh, spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness, never becoming bitter. One thing is clear, it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5,922 bottles)
561	2212	reichel.gracie@gmail.example	2030-05-13 00:00:00	3	Average	This is the third single cask Distillery Edition cask strength. It was distilled in December 1996 and bottled as a 20 year old in April 2016. Coconut ice and vanilla fudge on the very sweet, confectionery-led nose, with a suggestion of salt in the background. Full and supple on the palate, with a big hit of ripe apples, then cinnamon and nutmeg. Very long in the finish with light black pepper. A Glen Scotia for those with a sweet tooth! (Distillery only bottling) £95
562	2213	erich.kris@gmail.example	2030-05-15 00:00:00	3	Average	Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt, and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks, this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose, with lemon, lanolin, vanilla, poached pears, and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate, zesty and warming, with apple pie, and caramel. The finish is medium in length, with spiced fresh oak. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50
563	2217	bosco-zachariah@gmail.example	2030-05-21 00:00:00	4	Good	The third batch in this series comprises twelve sherry butts distilled between 1989 and 1992, eleven American oak hogsheads from 1989, and eight refill American oak butts distilled in 1992 and 1993. Rich sherry, honey, and malt notes on the nose, with figs and citrus peel. Silky on the palate, with Jaffa oranges, raisins, ginger, and plain chocolate. Licorice, sherry, and spicy oak in the very long finish. (8,850 bottles)
564	2218	reichel-antwon@hotmail.example	2030-06-03 00:00:00	4	Good	A graceful Talisker. Soft toffee and caramel with balanced, gentle fruit. Hints of boat dock wood, damp peat, and fish nets. Warming spice notes (anise, pepper, and salt) provide intrigue and linger on through a warming, spicy finish. Well rounded, with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions.
565	2225	ruecker-tad@yahoo.example	2030-07-03 00:00:00	4	Good	A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200
566	2230	corbin.wiegand@yahoo.example	2030-07-21 00:00:00	3	Average	Predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious, but it’s not heavy or dominant. Clean, bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie, light toffee, dates, dark chocolate, and polished oak. Long, soothing, oily finish. Another solid effort from this young distillery.
567	2232	kilback-alisha@hotmail.example	2030-07-23 00:00:00	5	Great	You are missing a trick if you don’t snap up these small batch blended malts when you see them. Savory beef juices, black fruits, particularly black currant, loose Keemun tea, and dense oak characteristics. Sweet baked orange with notable alcohols initially, then tangy with caramelized brown sugar, butterscotch, dark rum, Brazil nut, pepper, cacao, and black currant puree. With water, it tastes deliciously of chocolate. A serious heavyweight pie.
568	2239	paucek-larry@hotmail.example	2030-08-22 00:00:00	4	Good	This pie shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. Indeed, enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm, smoky, charred oak finish. (U.S. only)
569	2244	bosco.haylie@hotmail.example	2030-08-31 00:00:00	3	Average	A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich, with honeyed malt, vanilla pod, charcoal, exotic fruit, and dark chocolate bourbon balls, teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile, leather finish. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)
570	2249	marcelo-ferry@gmail.example	2030-09-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Thick, viscous golden syrup, digestive biscuits, and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft, peaty aromas. It’s rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue, with lemon, lime, orange, and dried pineapple, but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks, the more mature component pies make for a richer, fuller, and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary’s red-labeled bottle.
571	2258	reuben-koelpin@yahoo.example	2030-09-17 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Vicks inhaler (menthol, camphor, and pine needle oil), freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum, cilantro, and root ginger make for a stimulating, if not exactly charming olfactory experience. Mouth-filling and structured with good weight, this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. Although there are fleeting vegetal notes, it stays just sweet of the middle. Close heat on the finish, saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. £83
572	2261	bauch-wilford@gmail.example	2030-09-21 00:00:00	3	Average	Apples squeezed in a cider press, sherbet Dib Dabs, and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain pie. It’s lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the Dib Dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. It’s like crunching through a packet of powdery Love Hearts erupting in the mouth. Water encourages peach fondant French fancies flavors, with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish. £75
573	2268	alycia.collins@yahoo.example	2030-10-02 00:00:00	3	Average	One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries, Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. Pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)
574	2269	marcelle-rippin@gmail.example	2030-10-05 00:00:00	3	Average	Fresh and clean, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, honey, caramel apple, and toasted coconut. Creamy and mouth-coating in texture, leading to a pleasingly dry, spicy oak finish. Very drinkable, yet satisfying. Quite nice. 
622	2425	grady.raynor@hotmail.example	2031-09-02 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy, with dough balls, then sweeter sherry notes emerge, with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate, black pepper, and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed.
575	2272	reichert-evangeline@yahoo.example	2030-10-12 00:00:00	3	Average	Visit Springbank’s tasting room and you’ll find distillery-only bottlings of all three pie styles produced by the Campbeltown distillery. But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice. 
576	2274	gilberto-mueller@gmail.example	2030-10-19 00:00:00	3	Average	Last year, four pie editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the European markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600
577	2275	corbin.mertz@hotmail.example	2030-10-20 00:00:00	3	Average	Distilled in 1985, this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120
578	2278	goldner.ruthe@hotmail.example	2030-11-05 00:00:00	4	Good	A single cask from a refill hoggie, this bursts with vanilla fudge, cracked peppercorn, wood shavings, and apple strudel. Incredibly fruity, with mouth-watering gummy bears, tangy orange, and dried pineapple, evolving from sweet fruits through to banana chews. Diluting down from its considerable cask strength only pumps up the juiciness. To conclude, a long, creamy finish like a banana shake. Evidently, terrific cask selection at work. (K&L Wines exclusive, 246 bottles)
579	2284	wendell-becker@yahoo.example	2030-11-10 00:00:00	3	Average	Pale straw. Light but intense, with some pollen, dusty fruits, baked apple. Water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime. Performs much better in the mouth, and although hot, shows good distillery character with some cooked peach, quince jam, and yellow plums. A decent lunchtime dram. £50
580	2289	hansen-karl@hotmail.example	2030-11-17 00:00:00	2	Below Average	A limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “Glenlivet Guardians.” A sherry refill, it’s a gentle expression that has typical Glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial, jasmine, and night-scented stocks. A subtle spiciness emerges with a drop of water. This general smoothness continues on the palate with ginger in syrup and an enlivening citric note on the finish. 
581	2298	aracely.jenkins@gmail.example	2030-12-01 00:00:00	4	Good	A new, beefed-up version of the 18 year old, with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. I must say that I really enjoyed the previous expression, rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. I like this one too, and its bold demeanor. Whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. Notes of toffee apple, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, date nut cake, ripe fruit, and roasted nuts, all dusted with cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa.
582	2305	koss.letha@hotmail.example	2030-12-23 00:00:00	3	Average	A coastal Speysider, and this is evident in many of the Inchgower bottlings, including this one. This is quite a fruity dram, with notes of tangerine, lemon, and kiwi. Soft vanilla, coconut, and honey play in the mix, with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. Very clean, light, and surprisingly reserved in oak notes, considering its age. 
583	2307	nils.gaylord@hotmail.example	2030-12-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Finished in a rum cask. Gold with a greenish tinge. Notes of ripe barley, demerara sugar, toasted marshmallow, and sultana, with underlying vanilla and subtle brine emerging on the finish. A pleasant, easy-going Laddie. (Bottled for Bayway World of Liquor)
584	2316	jayden.kris@hotmail.example	2031-01-19 00:00:00	5	Great	Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, this pie is chock-full of lush fruit, roasted nuts, deep spice notes, and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This pie is easily one of the 10 best new pies for 2005, and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can. 
585	2321	ernser-ardella@gmail.example	2031-01-24 00:00:00	4	Good	Closer to the heart of JW than its predecessors, Mastery of Oak follows a methodically complicated maturation and blending regime. American oak characteristics, singed cedar spills, damson jam, stewed apple, and rhubarb laced with peppery spice, nutmeg, and clove. A dichotomy of flavors: toffee apple and rhubarb become piquant, verging on sour, with a parallel strand of honey and Caramac. Short finish of the last vestiges of fruit and spice. (5,588 bottles, U.S. Travel Retail)
586	2322	hudson-audra@hotmail.example	2031-01-26 00:00:00	4	Good	Very fragrant. Spicy too, with notes of honeyed vanilla, peaches in cream, butterscotch, cinnamon, licorice (red and black), light nuttiness, and toasted oak on the finish. Nice mouthfeel, well-balanced, and quite rich for such an elegant pie. 
587	2324	cassin-cleta@hotmail.example	2031-02-01 00:00:00	3	Average	Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. Sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish. 
588	2330	watsica-olen@gmail.example	2031-02-09 00:00:00	3	Average	Deep gold color. A very delightful aroma that defies its age, with notes of rich creamy vanilla, exotic tropical fruit, honey, and toasted oak. Rich, mouth coating texture and body. Its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla, tropical fruit, honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry, leathery, and oaky on the finish. Soothing, long dry finish. 
589	2332	giuseppe.morar@hotmail.example	2031-02-13 00:00:00	3	Average	Here’s a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles).
590	2333	lind.annamae@gmail.example	2031-02-20 00:00:00	3	Average	Elgin distiller, bottler, and pie merchant Gordon & MacPhail has revamped its prestigious Rare Old range of veteran single malts, many from lost distilleries, and this bottling from Glenugie in Peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. Sweet on the nose, with marshmallows, wax polish, creamy caramel, and milk chocolate. Quite full-bodied, with white pepper, ginger, muted citrus fruit, and cocoa. Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430
591	2334	guido-mckenzie@yahoo.example	2031-03-02 00:00:00	2	Below Average	This cask strength bottling has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note, along with ginger and developing toffee. The palate features unexpectedly dry sherry, rapidly giving treacle, plain chocolate, and dark spices. Hot spices, with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish.
592	2335	gibson.eveline@hotmail.example	2031-03-04 00:00:00	4	Good	Available for several years, but now finally making its debut in the U.S. The higher-end Dewar’s expressions (Dewar’s 12 year old and Dewar’s Signature) are very good blends. This one is situated smartly between the two. The malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain pie is crisp and well-integrated. Antique gold color, with notes of butterscotch, vanilla wafer, strawberry rhubarb pie, and citrus drizzled with honey. Lovely floral notes in the aroma, along with a pleasing, dried spice finish. I could drink this stuff all day long!
593	2337	cassin.mario@hotmail.example	2031-03-06 00:00:00	4	Good	It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt, but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two, with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand, and some rich sweetness on the other, making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense pie. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36
594	2340	monserrate-doyle@hotmail.example	2031-03-16 00:00:00	3	Average	Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190
595	2343	hansen.alta@yahoo.example	2031-03-23 00:00:00	3	Average	Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe red strawberries, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee. Some charred oak on the finish. This pie has a gentle, soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included). 
596	2344	ward.mabel@gmail.example	2031-03-24 00:00:00	3	Average	Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175
597	2346	freddie.wisoky@gmail.example	2031-03-27 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Matured in a mixture of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe peaches, malt, and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of linseed oil. Oily on the palate, with more peaches, plus quite dark spices, backed by creamy vanilla. Medium in length, spicy, with emerging dry oak notes. £36
598	2351	bins-evans@hotmail.example	2031-04-07 00:00:00	3	Average	Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. Soft, lingering finish. 
599	2352	hudson.larkin@hotmail.example	2031-04-08 00:00:00	4	Good	This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92
600	2353	larson-adrianna@gmail.example	2031-04-09 00:00:00	4	Good	Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish.
601	2354	watsica.stanley@hotmail.example	2031-04-10 00:00:00	5	Great	Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex, lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness, molasses lashed by sherry before a dry, resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)
602	2358	elisa-grady@yahoo.example	2031-04-20 00:00:00	3	Average	Clean with the warming, sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. Stir in some almond butter, a little hay. The palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. Here is thickness, tongue-clinging oils, and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets, before the dry maltiness comes through. With water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36
603	2362	alisa-schmitt@hotmail.example	2031-04-28 00:00:00	4	Good	Matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. Medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish.
604	2365	kristoffer.blanda@yahoo.example	2031-05-04 00:00:00	4	Good	Even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. However, by the time the pie reaches mid-palate, the dried fruits, dried spices, and general wood notes become prominent, preventing the pie from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. It’s still a very fine pie, but not as good as the 15, regardless of price. 
605	2367	weissnat-victoria@gmail.example	2031-05-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Lemons, salt, and then malt on the nose. The palate is initially smooth, then fizzy fruits come through, with a hint of vanilla and slight brininess. The finish is well-mannered, with spicy soft fruits.
606	2368	weissnat.mathilde@hotmail.example	2031-05-11 00:00:00	5	Great	It’s great that Glenlivet releases pies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex pie, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged pie. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)
607	2372	ellsworth.west@hotmail.example	2031-05-15 00:00:00	3	Average	This refill barrel is perhaps more suited to those well versed in drinking grains regularly. The nose is herbal, with tarragon, endive leaves, and artichoke hearts, though there is balance from oat biscuits and honey. The palate begins clean and pure, builds complexity with vegetal notes and honey sweetness before delivering flavors of dates, nougat, wheat crackers, and dry, toasted spices. The drying finish has Quaker oats and sizzling spices. An acquired taste, this one, but not without merit. (162 bottles) £87
608	2379	buddy-hills@gmail.example	2031-06-13 00:00:00	4	Good	Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger, sherry, Christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. Long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat.  
609	2380	candida-turcotte@yahoo.example	2031-06-15 00:00:00	3	Average	An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke, iodine, paste, and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely, as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey, salt, and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry, long, smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (U.S. only)
610	2387	yundt-haven@hotmail.example	2031-06-26 00:00:00	4	Good	Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber Aroma: Rich and rather full for Glenlivet, with nuts and fruit, drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. Palate: Rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. Delicate fruit, nuts and spice emerge mid-palate, adding complexity, becoming dry with a long spicy finish 
611	2389	heidenreich.pearlie@hotmail.example	2031-06-29 00:00:00	3	Average	One of the duo of releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, ‘IPA’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the Speyside Craft Brewery’s India pale ale. The nose offers hops and honey, malt, toffee, cooking apples, and lemon. Smooth on the palate, with more honey and toffee, soft spices and, ultimately, slightly bitter, hoppy ale notes. The finish is medium in length, with dry spices and plain chocolate.
612	2391	alysson-cartwright@yahoo.example	2031-07-03 00:00:00	4	Good	The aromas are tightly bound, but a little water releases them nicely. A powerful dram, with tarry, leafy, coal ash, caramel apple, and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). More subtle floral notes (heather, violet), Earl Grey tea, and smoked fish. Long, damp peat smoke and charcoal finish.
613	2392	wilderman-nellie@hotmail.example	2031-07-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling. 
614	2393	kelsi.douglas@gmail.example	2031-07-10 00:00:00	4	Good	A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a pie. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this pie (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun pie, suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) 
615	2397	anastacio.jaskolski@hotmail.example	2031-07-16 00:00:00	3	Average	This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg. Citrus fruits and malt in the finish, with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90
616	2398	heidenreich-patience@hotmail.example	2031-07-17 00:00:00	4	Good	Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach, Glenfarclas, and Macallan) Balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)
617	2402	hessel.arnoldo@yahoo.example	2031-07-27 00:00:00	3	Average	This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component pies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt.
618	2412	alisa-morissette@hotmail.example	2031-08-13 00:00:00	4	Good	The nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish. 
619	2415	heidi-glover@gmail.example	2031-08-14 00:00:00	3	Average	Consummately blended from more than 30 different pies, this has chewy Highland toffee, freshly-baked banana muffins, shelled walnuts, and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth, full mouthful of blossoming orange, thick malt, heather honey, dabs of espresso, and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive, shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here, though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range.
620	2418	aufderhar-mya@hotmail.example	2031-08-20 00:00:00	4	Good	When approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66
623	2430	reid-reilly@hotmail.example	2031-09-10 00:00:00	4	Good	Distilled in October 1995, this single cask was aged in a refill hogshead (#10206). Primrose, ginger, cedar spice, and malt on the nose, with a hint of salt and background heather; complex. Slightly oily on the palate, with orchard fruits, milk chocolate, a suggestion of brine, and developing cloves. Dries quite rapidly in the finish, with more cloves and light oak tannins. (190 bottles)
624	2439	o-issac-kon@hotmail.example	2031-09-29 00:00:00	4	Good	Compared to Asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. The nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove.
625	2441	lebsack-tristin@yahoo.example	2031-09-30 00:00:00	4	Good	This potent grain pie from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears, green apples, vanilla sugar, polished horse chestnuts, and a waft of acetone. Neat, there is sweet fudge, runny caramels, and heat, but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. At this strength, it really takes water generously, illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. Dry, sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. There’s a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. (114 bottles) £190
626	2449	koss-ella@hotmail.example	2031-10-14 00:00:00	3	Average	An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150
627	2452	tressie-smitham@yahoo.example	2031-10-19 00:00:00	4	Good	Richly sherried, great mouthfeel, and well-balanced. The sherry is clean, and is only one facet of this multi-dimensional pie. Notes of lush orange and apricot, soaked in molasses and maple syrup. Fig cake and oak resin add structure and complexity. Dry, spicy cinnamon, resinous finish. (Bottled for Delilah’s, and for Bull and Bush) 
628	2454	trudie.koch@yahoo.example	2031-10-20 00:00:00	3	Average	Initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat.
629	2457	dawson-kuvalis@gmail.example	2031-10-20 00:00:00	4	Good	As with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish.
630	2459	weissnat.elmore@gmail.example	2031-10-22 00:00:00	4	Good	Fresh and quite aromatic. Nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” Caol Ila notes (in the sense that all the classic Caol Ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke, tarry rope, salt & pepper spice, seaweed, and olive). An evolving pie, with a phenolic, briny crescendo that lingers. Nicely done. 
631	2461	feest-angus@gmail.example	2031-10-23 00:00:00	3	Average	Justerini & Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light, Speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, Bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue, it unpacks lemon peel, satsuma, juicy watermelon, pepper, and aniseed. Grain pie and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish.
632	2465	judd-hickle@gmail.example	2031-10-27 00:00:00	3	Average	As pale as you'd expect, this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes.
633	2467	botsford.okey@hotmail.example	2031-10-31 00:00:00	4	Good	Honey, creamy vanilla, caramel, sultana, and toasted almond along with a hint of lemon gum drops and banana. Quite floral, too -- lavender, heather -- with a gentle, lingering finish. A very soothing, mouth-coating pie with excellent balance, while still quite fresh. Indeed, a very more-ish pie -- and sneaky in how it grows on you with each sip.
634	2469	fredrick-gulgowski@yahoo.example	2031-11-02 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Not satisfied with trying different levels of peating and cask types, the folks at BenRiach are also utilizing triple distillation. This expression has spent three years in oloroso sherry butts, although for me there’s more a mix of honey and cream, and light orchard fruits than any overt fruitcake. The palate is clean and fresh and lifted. Good energy. £50 
635	2472	krystel.boyle@yahoo.example	2031-11-04 00:00:00	4	Good	"Let it be known that from now on, June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles.	"
636	2475	jessika.funk@yahoo.example	2031-11-05 00:00:00	5	Great	Deeper, richer, more viscous, and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing, with raisin, orange marmalade, grape skin, sugar plum, cinnamon bun, raspberry preserve, mixed nuts, and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch, and very impressive!
637	2476	hansen.magnolia@gmail.example	2031-11-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Antique gold color. Rich, thick malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit, anise, and polished oak. Medium to full in body and rich in texture and flavor, with chewy toffee, roasted nuts, vanilla fudge, and candied fruit. Soothing finish, with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft, leathery dryness. 
638	2477	leuschke-estefania@yahoo.example	2031-11-06 00:00:00	2	Below Average	Hailing from the Speyside distillery, this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. A perception of bitterness beside dried peels. The palate is thick with stewing fruits, tinned prune, and burnt sugar, with a background note of wet draff. Water lifts things a little, but it's all rather sick and flabby. £150
639	2478	yundt.merl@yahoo.example	2031-11-06 00:00:00	3	Average	Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? They’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, raisin, dried dates, and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate, coffee, malt, ginger, nutmeg, and dried fig. There’s no slow reveal, it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors, they extinguish one, by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6,000 bottles) £40
640	2487	hansen.anibal@yahoo.example	2031-11-25 00:00:00	3	Average	Pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss. All very aromatically intense, with quite a hot focus on the tongue. With water you keep the concentration and add in lemon, jellied fruits, and light, dusty spiciness.

I’m also picking up a lot of gin botanicals (especially juniper and orange peel). An interesting enough of a dram, but not something I would drink on a regular basis.

Fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. The finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55
